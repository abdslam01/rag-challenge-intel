89963a16-5d35-4f59-8014-a4003a4ca840,"THE TIGER, THE RAM, AND THE JACKAL",https://mlpp.pressbooks.pub/introphil/chapter/anansi-and-other-african-tales/,"Tiger  was returning home from hunting on one occasion, when he lighted on the kraal of Ram. Now, Tiger had never seen Ram before, and accordingly, approaching submissively, he said, “Good day, friend! What may your name be?”
The other in his gruff voice, and striking his breast with his forefoot, said, “I am Ram. Who are you?”
“Tiger,” answered the other, more dead than alive, and then, taking leave of Ram, he ran home as fast as he could.
Jackal lived at the same place as Tiger did, and the latter going to him, said, “Friend Jackal, I am quite out of breath, and am half dead with fright, for I have just seen a terrible looking fellow, with a large and thick head, and  on my asking him what his name was, he answered, ‘I am Ram.'”
“What a foolish fellow you are,” cried Jackal, “to let such a nice piece of flesh stand! Why did you do so? But we shall go to-morrow and eat it together.”
Next day the two set off for the kraal of Ram, and as they appeared over a hill, Ram, who had turned out to look about him, and was calculating where he should that day crop a tender salad, saw them, and he immediately went to his wife and said, “I fear this is our last day, for Jackal and Tiger are both coming against us. What shall we do?”
“Don’t be afraid,” said the wife, “but take up the child in your arms, go out with it, and pinch it to make it cry as if it were hungry.” Ram did so as the confederates came on.
No sooner did Tiger cast his eyes on Ram than fear again took possession of him, and he wished to turn back. Jackal had provided against this, and made Tiger fast to himself with a leather thong, and said, “Come on,” when Ram cried in a loud voice, and pinching his child at the same time, “You have done well, Friend Jackal, to have brought us Tiger to eat, for you hear how my child is crying for food.”
On these dreadful words Tiger, notwithstanding the entreaties of Jackal to let him go, to let him loose, set off in the greatest alarm, dragged Jackal after him over hill and valley, through bushes and over rocks, and never stopped to look behind him till he brought back himself and half-dead Jackal to his place again. And so Ram escaped.

Instead, however, of delivering this message as given, the Hare, either out of forgetfulness or malice, told mankind that as the Moon rose and died away, so Man should die and rise no more. The Hare, having returned to the Moon, was questioned as to the message delivered, and the Moon, having heard the true state of the case, became so enraged with him that she took up a hatchet to split his head; falling short, however, of that, the hatchet fell upon the upper lip of the Hare, and cut it severely. Hence it is that we see the “Hare-lip.” The Hare, being duly incensed at having received such treatment, raised his claws, and scratched the Moon’s face;  and the dark spots which we now see on the surface of the Moon are the scars which she received on that occasion.

863b51f7-eab2-49da-ae5b-7fa305f3e24d,THE DANCE FOR WATER OR RABBIT’S TRIUMPH,https://mlpp.pressbooks.pub/introphil/chapter/anansi-and-other-african-tales/,"There was a frightful drought. The rivers after a while dried up and even the springs gave no water.
The animals wandered around seeking drink, but to no avail. Nowhere was water to be found.
A great gathering of animals was held: Lion, Tiger, Wolf, Jackal, Elephant, all of them came together. What was to be done? That was the question. One had this plan, and another had that; but no plan seemed of value.
Finally one of them suggested: “Come, let all of us go to the dry river bed and dance; in that way we can tread out the water.”
Good! Everyone was satisfied and ready to begin instantly, excepting Rabbit, who said, “I will not go and dance. All of you are mad to attempt to get water from the ground by dancing.”
The other animals danced and danced, and ultimately danced the water to the surface. How glad they were. Everyone drank as much as he could, but Rabbit did not dance with them. So it was decided that Rabbit should have no water.
He laughed at them: “I will nevertheless drink some of your water.”
That evening he proceeded leisurely to the river bed where the dance had been, and drank as much as he wanted. The following morning the animals saw the footprints of Rabbit in the ground, and Rabbit shouted to them: “Aha! I did have some of the water, and it was most refreshing and tasted fine.”
Quickly all the animals were called together. What were they to do? How were they to get Rabbit in their hands? All had some means to propose; the one suggested this, and the other that.
Finally old Tortoise moved slowly forward, foot by foot: “I will catch Rabbit.”
“You? How? What do you think of yourself?” shouted the others in unison.
“Rub my shell with pitch,  and I will go to the edge of the water and lie down. I will then resemble a stone, so that when Rabbit steps on me his feet will stick fast.”
“Yes! Yes! That’s good.”
And in a one, two, three, Tortoise’s shell was covered with pitch, and foot by foot he moved away to the river. At the edge, close to the water, he lay down and drew his head into his shell.
Rabbit during the evening came to get a drink. “Ha!” he chuckled sarcastically, “they are, after all, quite decent. Here they have placed a stone, so now I need not unnecessarily wet my feet.”
Rabbit trod with his left foot on the stone, and there it stuck. Tortoise then put his head out. “Ha! old Tortoise! And it’s you, is it, that’s holding me. But here I still have another foot. I’ll give you a good clout.” Rabbit gave Tortoise what he said he would with his right fore foot, hard and straight; and there his foot remained.
“I have yet a hind foot, and with it I’ll kick you.” Rabbit drove his hind foot down. This also rested on Tortoise where it struck.
“But still another foot remains, and now I’ll tread you.” He stamped his foot down, but it stuck like the others.
He used his head to hammer Tortoise, and his tail as a whip, but both met the same fate as his feet, so there he was tight and fast down to the pitch.
Tortoise now slowly turned himself round and foot by foot started for the other animals, with Rabbit on his back.
“Ha! ha! ha! Rabbit! How does it look now? Insolence does not pay after all,” shouted the animals.
Now advice was sought. What should they do with Rabbit? He certainly must die. But how? One said, “Behead him”; another, “Some severe penalty.”
“Rabbit, how are we to kill you?”
“It does not affect me,” Rabbit said. “Only a shameful death please do not pronounce.”
“And what is that?” they all shouted.
“To take me by my tail and dash my head against a stone; that I pray and beseech you don’t do.”
“No, but just so you’ll die. That is decided.”
It was decided Rabbit should die by taking him by his tail and dashing his head to pieces against some stone. But who is to do it?
Lion, because he is the most powerful one.
Good! Lion should do it. He stood up, walked to the front, and poor Rabbit was brought to him. Rabbit pleaded and beseeched that he couldn’t die such a miserable death.
Lion took Rabbit firmly by the tail and swung him around. The white skin slipped off from Rabbit, and there Lion stood with the white bit of skin and hair in his paw. Rabbit was free.

In a country which is full of wild beasts of all sorts there once lived a jackal and a hedgehog, and, unlike though they were, the two animals made great friends, and were often seen in each other’s company.
One afternoon they were walking along a road together, when the jackal, who was the taller of the two, exclaimed:
‘Oh! there is a barn full of corn; let us go and eat some.’
‘Yes, do let us!’ answered the hedgehog. So they went to the barn, and ate till they could eat no more. Then the jackal put on his shoes, which he had taken off so as to make no noise, and they returned to the high road.
After they had gone some way they met a panther, who stopped, and bowing politely, said:
‘Excuse my speaking to you, but I cannot help admiring those shoes of yours. Do you mind telling me who made them?’
‘Yes, I think they are rather nice,’ answered the jackal; ‘I made them myself, though.’
‘Could you make me a pair like them?’ asked the panther eagerly.
‘I would do my best, of course,’ replied the jackal; ‘but you must kill me a cow, and when we have eaten the flesh I will take the skin and make your shoes out of it.’
So the panther prowled about until he saw a fine cow grazing apart from the rest of the herd. He killed it instantly, and then gave a cry to the jackal and hedgehog to come to the place where he was. They soon skinned the dead beasts, and spread its skin out to dry, after which they had a grand feast before they curled themselves up for the night, and slept soundly.
Next morning the jackal got up early and set to work upon the shoes, while the panther sat by and looked on with delight. At last they were finished, and the jackal arose and stretched himself.
‘Now go and lay them in the sun out there,’ said he; ‘in a couple of hours they will be ready to put on; but do not attempt to wear them before, or you will feel them most uncomfortable. But I see the sun is high in the heavens, and we must be continuing our journey.’
The panther, who always believed what everybody told him, did exactly as he was bid, and in two hours’ time began to fasten on the shoes. They certainly set off his paws wonderfully, and he stretched out his forepaws and looked at them with pride. But when he tried to walk–ah! that was another story! They were so stiff and hard that he nearly shrieked every step he took, and at last he sank down where he was, and actually began to cry.
After some time some little partridges who were hopping about heard the poor panther’s groans, and went up to see what was the matter. He had never tried to make his dinner off them, and they had always been quite friendly.
‘You seem in pain,’ said one of them, fluttering close to him, ‘can we help you?’
‘Oh, it is the jackal! He made me these shoes; they are so hard and tight that they hurt my feet, and I cannot manage to kick them off.’
‘Lie still, and we will soften them,’ answered the kind little partridge. And calling to his brothers, they all flew to the nearest spring, and carried water in their beaks, which they poured over the shoes. This they did till the hard leather grew soft, and the panther was able to slip his feet out of them.
‘Oh, thank you, thank you,’ he cried, skipping round with joy. ‘I feel a different creature. Now I will go after the jackal and pay him my debts.’ And he bounded away into the forest.
But the jackal had been very cunning, and had trotted backwards and forwards and in and out, so that it was very difficult to know which track he had really followed. At length, however, the panther caught sight of his enemy, at the same moment that the jackal had caught sight of him. The panther gave a loud roar, and sprang forward, but the jackal was too quick for him and plunged into a dense thicket, where the panther could not follow.
Disgusted with his failure, but more angry than ever, the panther lay down for a while to consider what he should do next, and as he was thinking, an old man came by.
‘Oh! father, tell me how I can repay the jackal for the way he has served me!’ And without more ado he told his story.
‘If you take my advice,’ answered the old man, ‘you will kill a cow, and invite all the jackals in the forest to the feast. Watch them carefully while they are eating, and you will see that most of them keep their eyes on their food. But if one of them glances at you, you will know that is the traitor.’
The panther, whose manners were always good, thanked the old man, and followed his counsel. The cow was killed, and the partridges flew about with invitations to the jackals, who gathered in large numbers to the feast. The wicked jackal came amongst them; but as the panther had only seen him once he could not distinguish him from the rest. However, they all took their places on wooden seats placed round the dead cow, which was laid across the boughs of a fallen tree, and began their dinner, each jackal fixing his eyes greedily on the piece of meat before him. Only one of them seemed uneasy, and every now and then glanced in the direction of his host. This the panther noticed, and suddenly made a bound at the culprit and seized his tail; but again the jackal was too quick for him, and catching up a knife he cut off his tail and darted into the forest, followed by all the rest of the party. And before the panther had recovered from his surprise he found himself alone.
‘What am I to do now?’ he asked the old man, who soon came back to see how things had turned out.
‘It is very unfortunate, certainly,’ answered he; ‘but I think I know where you can find him. There is a melon garden about two miles from here, and as jackals are very fond of melons they are nearly sure to have gone there to feed. If you see a tailless jackal you will know that he is the one you want.’ So the panther thanked him and went his way.
Now the jackal had guessed what advice the old man would give his enemy, and so, while his friends were greedily eating the ripest melons in the sunniest corner of the garden, he stole behind them and tied their tails together. He had only just finished when his ears caught the sound of breaking branches; and he cried: ‘Quick! quick! here comes the master of the garden!’ And the jackals sprang up and ran away in all directions, leaving their tails behind them. And how was the panther to know which was his enemy?
‘They none of them had any tails,’ he said sadly to the old man, ‘and I am tired of hunting them. I shall leave them alone and go and catch something for supper.’
Of course the hedgehog had not been able to take part in any of these adventures; but as soon as all danger was over, the jackal went to look for his friend, whom he was lucky enough to find at home.
‘Ah, there you are,’ he said gaily. ‘I have lost my tail since I saw you last. And other people have lost theirs too; but that is no matter! I am hungry, so come with me to the shepherd who is sitting over there, and we will ask him to sell us one of his sheep.’
‘Yes, that is a good plan,’ answered the hedgehog. And he walked as fast as his little legs would go to keep up with the jackal. When they reached the shepherd the jackal pulled out his purse from under his foreleg, and made his bargain.
‘Only wait till to-morrow,’ said the shepherd, ‘and I will give you the biggest sheep you ever saw. But he always feeds at some distance from the rest of the flock, and it would take me a long time to catch him.’
‘Well, it is very tiresome, but I suppose I must wait,’ replied the jackal. And he and the hedgehog looked about for a nice dry cave in which to make themselves comfortable for the night. But, after they had gone, the shepherd killed one of his sheep, and stripped off his skin, which he sewed tightly round a greyhound he had with him, and put a cord round its neck. Then he lay down and went to sleep.
Very, very early, before the sun was properly up, the jackal and the hedgehog were pulling at the shepherd’s cloak.
‘Wake up,’ they said, ‘and give us that sheep. We have had nothing to eat all night, and are very hungry.’
The shepherd yawned and rubbed his eyes. ‘He is tied up to that tree; go and take him.’ So they went to the tree and unfastened the cord, and turned to go back to the cave where they had slept, dragging the greyhound after them. When they reached the cave the jackal said to the hedgehog.
‘Before I kill him let me see whether he is fat or thin.’ And he stood a little way back, so that he might the better examine the animal. After looking at him, with his head on one side, for a minute or two, he nodded gravely.
‘He is quite fat enough; he is a good sheep.’
But the hedgehog, who sometimes showed more cunning than anyone would have guessed, answered:
‘My friend, you are talking nonsense. The wool is indeed a sheep’s wool, but the paws of my uncle the greyhound peep out from underneath.’
‘He is a sheep,’ repeated the jackal, who did not like to think anyone cleverer than himself.
‘Hold the cord while I look at him,’ answered the hedgehog.
Very unwillingly the jackal held the rope, while the hedgehog walked slowly round the greyhound till he reached the jackal again. He knew quite well by the paws and tail that it was a greyhound and not a sheep, that the shepherd had sold them; and as he could not tell what turn affairs might take, he resolved to get out of the way.
‘Oh! yes, you are right,’ he said to the jackal; ‘but I never can eat till I have first drunk. I will just go and quench my thirst from that spring at the edge of the wood, and then I shall be ready for breakfast.’
‘Don’t be long, then,’ called the jackal, as the hedgehog hurried off at his best pace. And he lay down under a rock to wait for him.
More than an hour passed by and the hedgehog had had plenty of time to go to the spring and back, and still there was no sign of him. And this was very natural, as he had hidden himself in some long grass under a tree!
At length the jackal guessed that for some reason his friend had run away, and determined to wait for his breakfast no longer. So he went up to the place where the greyhound had been tethered and untied the rope. But just as he was about to spring on his back and give him a deadly bite, the jackal heard a low growl, which never proceeded from the throat of any sheep. Like a flash of lightning the jackal threw down the cord and was flying across the plain; but though his legs were long, the greyhound’s legs were longer still, and he soon came up with his prey. The jackal turned to fight, but he was no match for the greyhound, and in a few minutes he was lying dead on the ground, while the greyhound was trotting peacefully back to the shepherd.

Now that the father and elder brother were both dead, all that was left of the jackal family was one son, who was no less cunning than the others had been. He did not like staying in the same place any better than they, and nobody ever knew in what part of the country he might be found next.
One day, when we was wandering about he beheld a nice fat sheep, which was cropping the grass and seemed quite contented with her lot.
‘Good morning,’ said the jackal, ‘I am so glad to see you. I have been looking for you everywhere.’
‘For ME?’ answered the sheep, in an astonished voice; ‘but we have never met before!’
‘No; but I have heard of you. Oh! You don’t know what fine things I have heard! Ah, well, some people have all the luck!’
‘You are very kind, I am sure,’ answered the sheep, not knowing which way to look. ‘Is there any way in which I can help you?’
‘There is something that I had set my heart on, though I hardly like to propose it on so short an acquaintance; but from what people have told me, I thought that you and I might keep house together comfortably, if you would only agree to try. I have several fields belonging to me, and if they are kept well watered they bear wonderful crops.’
‘Perhaps I might come for a short time,’ said the sheep, with a little hesitation; ‘and if we do not get on, we can part company.’
‘Oh, thank you, thank you,’ cried the jackal; ‘do not let us lose a moment.’ And he held out his paw in such an inviting manner that the sheep got up and trotted beside him till they reached home.
‘Now,’ said the jackal, ‘you go to the well and fetch the water, and I will pour it into the trenches that run between the patches of corn.’ And as he did so he sang lustily. The work was very hard, but the sheep did not grumble, and by-and-by was rewarded at seeing the little green heads poking themselves through earth. After that the hot sun ripened them quickly, and soon harvest time was come. Then the grain was cut and ground and ready for sale.
When everything was complete, the jackal said to the sheep:
‘Now let us divide it, so that we can each do what we like with his share.’
‘You do it,’ answered the sheep; ‘here are the scales. You must weigh it carefully.’
So the jackal began to weigh it, and when he had finished, he counted out loud:
‘One, two, three, four, five, six, seven parts for the jackal, and one part for the sheep. If she likes it she can take it, if not, she can leave it.’
The sheep looked at the two heaps in silence- -one so large, the other so small; and then she answered:
‘Wait for a minute, while I fetch some sacks to carry away my share.’
But it was not sacks that the sheep wanted; for as soon as the jackal could no longer see her she set forth at her best pace to the home of the greyhound, where she arrived panting with the haste she had made.
‘Oh, good uncle, help me, I pray you!’ she cried, as soon as she could speak.
‘Why, what is the matter?’ asked the greyhound, looking up with astonishment.
‘I beg you to return with me, and frighten the jackal into paying me what he owes me,’ answered the sheep. ‘For months we have lived together, and I have twice every day drawn the water, while he only poured it into the trenches. Together we have reaped our harvest; and now, when the moment to divide our crop has come, he has taken seven parts for himself, and only left one for me.’
She finished, and giving herself a twist, passed her woolly tail across her eyes; while the greyhound watched her, but held his peace. Then he said:
‘Bring me a sack.’ And the sheep hastened away to fetch one. Very soon she returned, and laid the sack down before him.
‘Open it wide, that I may get in,’ cried he; and when he was comfortably rolled up inside he bade the sheep take him on her back, and hasten to the place where she had left the jackal.
She found him waiting for her, and pretending to be asleep, though she clearly saw him wink one of his eyes. However, she took no notice, but throwing the sack roughly on the ground, she exclaimed:
‘Now measure!’
At this the jackal got up, and going to the heap of grain which lay close by, he divided it as before into eight portions–seven for himself and one for the sheep.
‘What are you doing that for?’ asked she indignantly. ‘You know quite well that it was I who drew the water, and you who only poured it into the trenches.’
‘You are mistaken,’ answered the jackal. ‘It was I who drew the water, and you who poured it into the trenches. Anybody will tell you that! If you like, I will ask those people who are digging there!’
‘Very well,’ replied the sheep. And the jackal called out:
‘Ho! You diggers, tell me: Who was it you heard singing over the work?’
‘Why, it was you, of course, jackal! You sang so loud that the whole world might have heard you!’
‘And who it is that sings–he who draws the water, or he who empties it?’
‘Why, certainly he who draws the water!’
‘You hear?’ said the jackal, turning to the sheep. ‘Now come and carry away your own portion, or else I shall take it for myself.’
‘You have got the better of me,’ answered the sheep; ‘and I suppose I must confess myself beaten! But as I bear no malice, go and eat some of the dates that I have brought in that sack.’ And the jackal, who loved dates, ran instantly back, and tore open the mouth of the sack. But just as he was about to plunge his nose in he saw two brown eyes calmly looking at him. In an instant he had let fall the flap of the sack and bounded back to where the sheep was standing.
‘I was only in fun; and you have brought my uncle the greyhound. Take away the sack, we will make the division over again.’ And he began rearranging the heaps.
‘One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, for my mother the sheep, and one for the jackal,’ counted he; casting timid glances all the while at the sack.
‘Now you can take your share and go,’ said the sheep. And the jackal did not need twice telling! Whenever the sheep looked up, she still saw him flying, flying across the plain; and, for all I know, he may be flying across it still.

Long, long ago there lived, in a village called Keejee′jee, a woman whose husband died, leaving her with a little baby boy. She worked hard all day to get food for herself and child, but they lived very poorly and were most of the time half-starved.
When the boy, whose name was ’Mvoo′ Laa′na, began to get big, he said to his mother, one day: “Mother, we are always hungry. What work did my father do to support us?”
His mother replied: “Your father was a hunter. He set traps, and we ate what he caught in them.”
“Oho!” said ’Mvoo Laana; “that’s not work; that’s fun. I, too, will set traps, and see if we can’t get enough to eat.”
The next day he went into the forest and cut branches from the trees, and returned home in the evening.
The second day he spent making the branches into traps.
The third day he twisted cocoanut fiber into ropes.
The fourth day he set up as many traps as time would permit.
The fifth day he set up the remainder of the traps.
The sixth day he went to examine the traps, and they had caught so much game, beside what they needed for themselves, that he took a great quantity to the big town of Oongoo′ja, where he sold it and bought corn and other things, and the house was full of food; and, as this good fortune continued, he and his mother lived very comfortably.
But after a while, when he went to his traps he found nothing in them day after day.
One morning, however, he found that an ape had been caught in one of the traps, and he was about to kill it, when it said: “Son of Adam, I am Neea′nee, the ape; do not kill me. Take me out of this trap and let me go. Save me from the rain, that I may come and save you from the sun some day.”
So ’Mvoo Laana took him out of the trap and let him go.
When Neeanee had climbed up in a tree, he sat on a branch and said to the youth: “For your kindness I will give you a piece of advice: Believe me, men are all bad. Never do a good turn for a man; if you do, he will do you harm at the first opportunity.”
The second day, ’Mvoo Laana found a snake in the same trap. He started to the village to give the alarm, but the snake shouted: “Come back, son of Adam; don’t call the people from the village to come and kill me. I am Neeo′ka, the snake. Let me out of this trap, I pray you. Save me from the rain to-day, that I may be able to save you from the sun to-morrow, if you should be in need of help.”
So the youth let him go; and as he went he said, “I will return your kindness if I can, but do not trust any man; if you do him a kindness he will do you an injury in return at the first opportunity.”
The third day, ’Mvoo Laana found a lion in the same trap that had caught the ape and the snake, and he was afraid to go near it. But the lion said: “Don’t run away; I am Sim′ba Kong′way, the very old lion. Let me out of this trap, and I will not hurt you. Save me from the rain, that I may save you from the sun if you should need help.”
So ’Mvoo Laana believed him and let him out of the trap, and Simba Kongway, before going his way, said: “Son of Adam, you have been kind to me, and I will repay you with kindness if I can; but never do a kindness to a man, or he will pay you back with unkindness.”
The next day a man was caught in the same trap, and when the youth released him, he repeatedly assured him that he would never forget the service he had done him in restoring his liberty and saving his life.
Well, it seemed that he had caught all the game that could be taken in traps, and ’Mvoo Laana and his mother were hungry every day, with nothing to satisfy them, as they had been before. At last he said to his mother, one day: “Mother, make me seven cakes of the little meal we have left, and I will go hunting with my bow and arrows.” So she baked him the cakes, and he took them and his bow and arrows and went into the forest.
The youth walked and walked, but could see no game, and finally he found that he had lost his way, and had eaten all his cakes but one.
And he went on and on, not knowing whether he was going away from his home or toward it, until he came to the wildest and most desolate looking wood he had ever seen. He was so wretched and tired that he felt he must lie down and die, when suddenly he heard some one calling him, and looking up he saw Neeanee, the ape, who said, “Son of Adam, where are you going?”
“I don’t know,” replied ’Mvoo Laana, sadly; “I’m lost.”
“Well, well,” said the ape; “don’t worry. Just sit down here and rest yourself until I come back, and I will repay with kindness the kindness you once showed me.”
Then Neeanee went away off to some gardens and stole a whole lot of ripe paw-paws and bananas, and brought them to ’Mvoo Laana, and said: “Here’s plenty of food for you. Is there anything else you want? Would you like a drink?” And before the youth could answer he ran off with a calabash and brought it back full of water. So the youth ate heartily, and drank all the water he needed, and then each said to the other, “Good-bye, till we meet again,” and went their separate ways.
When ’Mvoo Laana had walked a great deal farther without finding which way he should go, he met Simba Kongway, who asked, “Where are you going, son of Adam?”
And the youth answered, as dolefully as before, “I don’t know; I’m lost.”
“Come, cheer up,” said the very old lion, “and rest yourself here a little. I want to repay with kindness to-day the kindness you showed me on a former day.”
So ’Mvoo Laana sat down. Simba Kongway went away, but soon returned with some game he had caught, and then he brought some fire, and the young man cooked the game and ate it. When he had finished he felt a great deal better, and they bade each other good-bye for the present, and each went his way.
After he had traveled another very long distance the youth came to a farm, and was met by a very, very old woman, who said to him: “Stranger, my husband has been taken very sick, and I am looking for some one to make him some medicine. Won’t you make it?” But he answered: “My good woman, I am not a doctor, I am a hunter, and never used medicine in my life. I can not help you.”
When he came to the road leading to the principal city he saw a well, with a bucket standing near it, and he said to himself: “That’s just what I want. I’ll take a drink of nice well-water. Let me see if the water can be reached.”
As he peeped over the edge of the well, to see if the water was high enough, what should he behold but a great big snake, which, directly it saw him, said, “Son of Adam, wait a moment.” Then it came out of the well and said: “How? Don’t you know me?”
“I certainly do not,” said the youth, stepping back a little.
“Well, well!” said the snake; “I could never forget you. I am Neeoka, whom you released from the trap. You know I said, ‘Save me from the rain, and I will save you from the sun.’ Now, you are a stranger in the town to which you are going; therefore hand me your little bag, and I will place in it the things that will be of use to you when you arrive there.”
So ’Mvoo Laana gave Neeoka the little bag, and he filled it with chains of gold and silver, and told him to use them freely for his own benefit. Then they parted very cordially.
When the youth reached the city, the first man he met was he whom he had released from the trap, who invited him to go home with him, which he did, and the man’s wife made him supper.
As soon as he could get away unobserved, the man went to the sultan and said: “There is a stranger come to my house with a bag full of chains of silver and gold, which he says he got from a snake that lives in a well. But although he pretends to be a man, I know that he is a snake who has power to look like a man.”
When the sultan heard this he sent some soldiers who brought ’Mvoo Laana and his little bag before him. When they opened the little bag, the man who was released from the trap persuaded the people that some evil would come out of it, and affect the children of the sultan and the children of the vizir.
Then the people became excited, and tied the hands of ’Mvoo Laana behind him.
But the great snake had come out of the well and arrived at the town just about this time, and he went and lay at the feet of the man who had said all those bad things about ’Mvoo Laana, and when the people saw this they said to that man: “How is this? There is the great snake that lives in the well, and he stays by you. Tell him to go away.”
But Neeoka would not stir. So they untied the young man’s hands, and tried in every way to make amends for having suspected him of being a wizard.
Then the sultan asked him, “Why should this man invite you to his home and then speak ill of you?”
And ’Mvoo Laana related all that had happened to him, and how the ape, the snake, and the lion had cautioned him about the results of doing any kindness for a man.
And the sultan said: “Although men are often ungrateful, they are not always so; only the bad ones. As for this fellow, he deserves to be put in a sack and drowned in the sea. He was treated kindly, and returned evil for good.”

Now, though the jackal was dead, he had left two sons behind him, every whit as cunning and tricky as their father. The elder of the two was a fine handsome creature, who had a pleasant manner and made many friends. The animal he saw most of was a hyena; and one day, when they were taking a walk together, they picked up a beautiful green cloak, which had evidently been dropped by some one riding across the plain on a camel. Of course each wanted to have it, and they almost quarrelled over the matter; but at length it was settled that the hyena should wear the cloak by day and the jackal by night. After a little while, however, the jackal became discontented with this arrangement, declaring that none of his friends, who were quite different from those of the hyena, could see the splendour of the mantle, and that it was only fair that he should sometimes be allowed to wear it by day. To this the hyena would by no means consent, and they were on the eve of a quarrel when the hyena proposed that they should ask the lion to judge between them. The jackal agreed to this, and the hyena wrapped the cloak about him, and they both trotted off to the lion’s den.
The jackal, who was fond of talking, at once told the story; and when it was finished the lion turned to the hyena and asked if it was true.
‘Quite true, your majesty,’ answered the hyena.
‘Then lay the cloak on the ground at my feet,’ said the lion, ‘and I will give my judgment.’ So the mantle was spread upon the red earth, the hyena and the jackal standing on each side of it.
There was silence for a few moments, and then the lion sat up, looking very great and wise.
‘My judgment is that the garment shall belong wholly to whoever first rings the bell of the nearest mosque at dawn to-morrow. Now go; for much business awaits me!’
All that night the hyena sat up, fearing lest the jackal should reach the bell before him, for the mosque was close at hand. With the first streak of dawn he bounded away to the bell, just as the jackal, who had slept soundly all night, was rising to his feet.
‘Good luck to you,’ cried the jackal. And throwing the cloak over his back he darted away across the plain, and was seen no more by his friend the hyena.
After running several miles the jackal thought he was safe from pursuit, and seeing a lion and another hyena talking together, he strolled up to join them.
‘Good morning,’ he said; ‘may I ask what is the matter? You seem very serious about something.’
‘Pray sit down,’ answered the lion. ‘We were wondering in which direction we should go to find the best dinner. The hyena wishes to go to the forest, and I to the mountains. What do you say?’
‘Well, as I was sauntering over the plain, just now, I noticed a flock of sheep grazing, and some of them had wandered into a little valley quite out of sight of the shepherd. If you keep among the rocks you will never be observed. But perhaps you will allow me to go with you and show you the way?’
‘You are really very kind,’ answered the lion. And they crept steadily along till at length they reached the mouth of the valley where a ram, a sheep and a lamb were feeding on the rich grass, unconscious of their danger.
‘How shall we divide them?’ asked the lion in a whisper to the hyena.
‘Oh, it is easily done,’ replied the hyena. ‘The lamb for me, the sheep for the jackal, and the ram for the lion.’
‘So I am to have that lean creature, which is nothing but horns, am I?’ cried the lion in a rage. ‘I will teach you to divide things in that manner!’ And he gave the hyena two great blows, which stretched him dead in a moment. Then he turned to the jackal and said: ‘How would you divide them?’
‘Quite differently from the hyena,’ replied the jackal. ‘You will breakfast off the lamb, you will dine off the sheep, and you will sup off the ram.’
‘Dear me, how clever you are! Who taught you such wisdom?’ exclaimed the lion, looking at him admiringly.
‘The fate of the hyena,’ answered the jackal, laughing, and running off at his best speed; for he saw two men armed with spears coming close behind the lion!
The jackal continued to run till at last he could run no longer. He flung himself under a tree panting for breath, when he heard a rustle amongst the grass, and his father’s old friend the hedgehog appeared before him.
‘Oh, is it you?’ asked the little creature; ‘how strange that we should meet so far from home!’
‘I have just had a narrow escape of my life,’ gasped the jackal, ‘and I need some sleep. After that we must think of something to do to amuse ourselves.’ And he lay down again and slept soundly for a couple of hours.
‘Now I am ready,’ said he; ‘have you anything to propose?’
‘In a valley beyond those trees,’ answered the hedgehog, ‘there is a small farmhouse where the best butter in the world is made. I know their ways, and in an hour’s time the farmer’s wife will be off to milk the cows, which she keeps at some distance. We could easily get in at the window of the shed where she keeps the butter, and I will watch, lest some one should come unexpectedly, while you have a good meal. Then you shall watch, and I will eat.’
‘That sounds a good plan,’ replied the jackal; and they set off together.
But when they reached the farmhouse the jackal said to the hedgehog: ‘Go in and fetch the pots of butter and I will hide them in a safe place.’
‘Oh no,’ cried the hedgehog, ‘I really couldn’t. They would find out directly! And, besides, it is so different just eating a little now and then.’
‘Do as I bid you at once,’ said the jackal, looking at the hedgehog so sternly that the little fellow dared say no more, and soon rolled the jars to the window where the jackal lifted them out one by one.
When they were all in a row before him he gave a sudden start.
‘Run for your life,’ he whispered to his companion; ‘I see the woman coming over the hill!’ And the hedgehog, his heart beating, set off as fast as he could. The jackal remained where he was, shaking with laughter, for the woman was not in sight at all, and he had only sent the hedgehog away because he did not want him to know where the jars of butter were buried. But every day he stole out to their hiding-place and had a delicious feast.
At length, one morning, the hedgehog suddenly said:
‘You never told me what you did with those jars?’
‘Oh, I hid them safely till the farm people should have forgotten all about them,’ replied the jackal. ‘But as they are still searching for them we must wait a little longer, and then I’ll bring them home, and we will share them between us.’
So the hedgehog waited and waited; but every time he asked if there was no chance of getting jars of butter the jackal put him off with some excuse. After a while the hedgehog became suspicious, and said:
‘I should like to know where you have hidden them. To-night, when it is quite dark, you shall show me the place.’
‘I really can’t tell you,’ answered the jackal. ‘You talk so much that you would be sure to confide the secret to somebody, and then we should have had our trouble for nothing, besides running the risk of our necks being broken by the farmer. I can see that he is getting disheartened, and very soon he will give up the search. Have patience just a little longer.’
The hedgehop said no more, and pretended to be satisfied; but when some days had gone by he woke the jackal, who was sleeping soundly after a hunt which had lasted several hours.
‘I have just had notice,’ remarked the hedgehog, shaking him, ‘that my family wish to have a banquet to-morrow, and they have invited you to it. Will you come?’
‘Certainly,’ answered the jackal, ‘with pleasure. But as I have to go out in the morning you can meet me on the road.’
‘That will do very well,’ replied the hedgehog. And the jackal went to sleep again, for he was obliged to be up early.
Punctual to the moment the hedgehog arrived at the place appointed for their meeting, and as the jackal was not there he sat down and waited for him.
‘Ah, there you are!’ he cried, when the dusky yellow form at last turned the corner. ‘I had nearly given you up! Indeed, I almost wish you had not come, for I hardly know where I shall hide you.’
‘Why should you hide me anywhere?’ asked the jackal. ‘What is the matter with you?’
‘Well, so many of the guests have brought their dogs and mules with them, that I fear it may hardly be safe for you to go amongst them. No; don’t run off that way,’ he added quickly, ‘because there is another troop that are coming over the hill. Lie down here, and I will throw these sacks over you; and keep still for your life, whatever happens.’
And what did happen was, that when the jackal was lying covered up, under a little hill, the hedgehog set a great stone rolling, which crushed him to death.

Once upon a time there was an old man who lived with his son in a small hut on the edge of the plain. He was very old, and had worked very hard, and when at last he was struck down by illness he felt that he should never rise from his bed again.
So, one day, he asked his wife summon their son, when he came back from his journey to the nearest town, where he had been to buy bread.
‘Come close, my son,’ said he; ‘I know myself well to be dying, and I have nothing to leave you but my falcon, my cat and my greyhound; but if you make good use of them you will never lack food. Be good to your mother, as you have been to me. And now farewell!’
Then he turned his face to the wall and died.
There was great mourning in the hut for many days, but at length the son rose up, and calling to his greyhound, his cat and his falcon, he left the house saying that he would bring back something for dinner. Wandering over the plain, he noticed a troop of gazelles, and pointed to his greyhound to give chase. The dog soon brought down a fine fat beast, and slinging it over his shoulders, the young man turned homewards. On the way, however, he passed a pond, and as he approached a cloud of birds flew into the air. Shaking his wrist, the falcon seated on it darted into the air, and swooped down upon the quarry he had marked, which fell dead to the ground. The young man picked it up, and put it in his pouch and then went towards home again.
Near the hut was a small barn in which he kept a little patch of corn, which grew close to the garden. Here a rat ran out almost under his feet, followed by another and another; but quick as thought the cat was upon them and not one escaped her.
When all the rats were killed, the young man left the barn. He took the path leading to the door of the hut, but stopped on feeling a hand laid on his shoulder.
‘Young man,’ said the ogre (for this was the stranger), ‘you have been a good son, and you deserve the piece of luck which has fallen on you this day. Come with me to that shining lake, and fear nothing.’
Wondering a little at what might be going to happen to him, the youth did as the ogre bade him, and when they reached the shore of the lake, the ogre turned and said to him:
‘Step into the water and shut your eyes! You will find yourself sinking slowly to the bottom; but take courage, all will go well. Only bring up as much silver as you can carry, and we will divide it between us.’
So the young man stepped bravely into the lake, and felt himself sinking, sinking, till he reached firm ground at last. In front of him lay four heaps of silver, and in the middle of them a curious white shining stone, marked over with strange characters, such as he had never seen before. He picked it up in order to examine it more closely, and as he held it the stone spoke.
‘As long as you hold me, all your wishes will come true,’ it said. ‘But hide me in your turban, and then call to the ogre that you are ready to come up.’
In a few minutes the young man stood again by the shores of the lake.
‘Well, where is the silver?’ asked the ogre, who was awaiting him.
‘Ah, my father, how can I tell you! So bewildered was I, and so dazzled with the splendours of everything I saw, that I stood like a statue, unable to move. Then hearing steps approaching I got frightened, and called to you, as you know.’
‘You are no better than the rest,’ cried the ogre, and turned away in a rage.
When he was out of sight the young man took the stone from his turban and looked at it. ‘I want the finest camel that can be found, and the most splendid garments,’ said he.
‘Shut your eyes then,’ replied the stone. And he shut them; and when he opened them again the camel that he had wished for was standing before him, while the festival robes of a desert prince hung from his shoulders. Mounting the camel, he whistled the falcon to his wrist, and, followed by his greyhound and his cat, he started homewards.
His mother was sewing at her door when this magnificent stranger rode up, and, filled with surprise, she bowed low before him.
‘Don’t you know me, mother?’ he said with a laugh. And on hearing his voice the good woman nearly fell to the ground with astonishment.
‘How have you got that camel and those clothes?’ asked she. ‘Can a son of mine have committed murder in order to possess them?’
‘Do not be afraid; they are quite honestly come by,’ answered the youth. ‘I will explain all by-and-by; but now you must go to the palace and tell the king I wish to marry his daughter.’
At these words the mother thought her son had certainly gone mad, and stared blankly at him. The young man guessed what was in her heart, and replied with a smile:
‘Fear nothing. Promise all that he asks; it will be fulfilled somehow.’
So she went to the palace, where she found the king sitting in the Hall of Justice listening to the requests of his people. The woman waited until all had been heard and the hall was empty, and then went up and knelt before the throne.
‘My son has sent me to ask for the hand of the princess,’ said she.
The king looked at her and thought that she was mad; but, instead of ordering his guards to turn her out, he answered gravely:
‘Before he can marry the princess he must build me a palace of ice, which can be warmed with fires, and where the rarest singing- birds can live!’
‘It shall be done, your Majesty,’ said she, and got up and left the hall.
Her son was anxiously awaiting her outside the palace gates, dressed in the clothes that he wore every day.
‘Well, what have I got to do?’ he asked impatiently, drawing his mother aside so that no one could overhear them.
‘Oh, something quite impossible; and I hope you will put the princess out of your head,’ she replied.
‘Well, but what is it?’ persisted he.
‘Nothing but build a palace of ice wherein fires can burn that shall keep it so warm that the most delicate singing-birds can live in it!’
‘I thought it would be something much harder than that,’ exclaimed the young man. ‘I will see about it at once.’ And leaving his mother, he went into the country and took the stone from his turban.
‘I want a palace of ice that can be warmed with fires and filled with the rarest singing-birds!’
‘Shut your eyes, then,’ said the stone; and he shut them, and when he opened them again there was the palace, more beautiful than anything he could have imagined, the fires throwing a soft pink glow over the ice.
‘It is fit even for the princess,’ thought he to himself.
As soon as the king awoke next morning he ran to the window, and there across the plain he beheld the palace.
‘That young man must be a great wizard; he may be useful to me.’ And when the mother came again to tell him that his orders had been fulfilled he received her with great honour, and told her to tell her son that the wedding was fixed for the following day.
The princess was delighted with her new home, and with her husband also; and several days slipped happily by, spent in discovering all the beautiful things that the palace contained. But at length the young man grew tired of always staying inside walls, and he told his wife that the next day he must leave her for a few hours, and go out hunting. ‘You will not mind?’ he asked. And she answered as became a good wife:
‘Yes, of course I shall mind; but I will spend the day in planning out some new dresses; and then it will be so delightful when you come back, you know!’
So the husband went off to hunt, with the falcon on his wrist, and the greyhound and the cat behind him–for the palace was so warm that even the cat did not mind living in it.
No sooner had he gone, than the ogre who had been watching his chance for many days, knocked at the door of the palace.
‘I have just returned from a far country,’ he said, ‘and I have some of the largest and most brilliant stones in the world with me. The princess is known to love beautiful things, perhaps she might like to buy some?’
Now the princess had been wondering for many days what trimming she should put on her dresses, so that they should outshine the dresses of the other ladies at the court balls. Nothing that she thought of seemed good enough, so, when the message was brought that the ogre and his wares were below, she at once ordered that he should be brought to her chamber.
Oh! what beautiful stones he laid before her; what lovely rubies, and what rare pearls! No other lady would have jewels like those–of that the princess was quite sure; but she cast down her eyes so that the ogre might not see how much she longed for them.
‘I fear they are too costly for me,’ she said carelessly; ‘and besides, I have hardly need of any more jewels just now.’
‘I have no particular wish to sell them myself,’ answered the ogre, with equal indifference. ‘But I have a necklace of shining stones which was left me by father, and one, the largest engraved with weird characters, is missing. I have heard that it is in your husband’s possession, and if you can get me that stone you shall have any of these jewels that you choose. But you will have to pretend that you want it for yourself; and, above all, do not mention me, for he sets great store by it, and would never part with it to a stranger! Tomorrow I will return with some jewels yet finer than those I have with me today. So, madam, farewell!’
Left alone, the princess began to think of many things, but chiefly as to whether she would persuade her husband to give her the stone or not. At one moment she felt he had already given so much to her that it was a shame to ask for the only object he had kept back. No, it would be mean; she could not do it! But then, those diamonds, and those string of pearls! After all, they had only been married a week, and the pleasure of giving it to her ought to be far greater than the pleasure of keeping it for himself. And she was sure it would be!
Well, that evening, when the young man had eaten his favourite dishes which the princess took care to have specially prepared for him, she sat down close beside him, and began stroking his head. For some time she did not speak, but listened attentively to all the adventures that had befallen him that day.
‘But I was thinking of you all the time,’ said he at the end, ‘and wishing that I could bring you back something you would like. But, alas! what is there that you do not possess already?’
‘How good of you not to forget me when you are in the midst of such dangers and hardships,’ answered she. ‘Yes, it is true I have many beautiful things; but if you want to give me a present–and tomorrow is my birthday–there IS one thing that I wish for very much.’
‘And what is that? Of course you shall have it directly!’ he asked eagerly.
‘It is that bright stone which fell out of the folds of your turban a few days ago,’ she answered, playing with his finger; ‘the little stone with all those funny marks upon it. I never saw any stone like it before.’
The young man did not answer at first; then he said, slowly:
‘I have promised, and therefore I must perform. But will you swear never to part from it, and to keep it safely about you always? More I cannot tell you, but I beg you earnestly to listen to this.’
The princess was a little startled by his manner, and began to be sorry that she had ever listened to the ogre. But she did not like to draw back, and pretended to be immensely delighted at her new toy, and kissed and thanked her husband for it.
‘After all I needn’t give it to the ogre,’ thought she as she dropped off to sleep.
Unluckily the next morning the young man went hunting again, and the ogre, who was watching, knew this, and did not come till much later than before. At the moment that he knocked at the door of the palace the princess had tired of all her employments, and her attendants were at their wits’ end how to amuse her, when a tall page dressed in scarlet came to announce that the ogre was below, and desired to know if the princess would speak to him.
‘Bring him forth at once!’ cried she, springing up from her cushions, and forgetting all her resolves of the previous night. In another moment she was bending with rapture over the glittering gems.
‘Have you got it?’ asked the ogre in a whisper, for the princess’s ladies were standing as near as they dared to catch a glimpse of the beautiful jewels.
‘Yes, here,’ she answered, slipping the stone from her sash and placing it among the rest. Then she raised her voice, and began to talk quickly of the prices of the chains and necklaces, and after some bargaining, to deceive the attendants, she declared that she liked one string of pearls better than all the rest, and that the ogre might take away the other things, which were not half as valuable as he supposed.
‘As you please, madam,’ said he, bowing himself out of the palace.
Soon after he had gone a curious thing happened. The princess carelessly touched the wall of her room, which was often to reflect the warm red light of the fire on the hearth, and found her hand quite wet. She turned round, and–was it her fancy? or did the fire burn more dimly than before? Hurriedly she passed into the picture gallery, where pools of water showed here and there on the floor, and a cold chill ran through her whole body. At that instant her frightened ladies came running down the stairs, crying:
‘Madam! madam! what has happened? The palace is disappearing under our eyes!’
‘My husband will be home very soon,’ answered the princess–who, though nearly as much frightened as her ladies, felt that she must set them a good example. ‘Wait till then, and he will tell us what to do.’
So they waited, seated on the highest chairs they could find, wrapped in their warmest garments, and with piles of cushions under their feet, while the poor birds flew with numbed wings hither and thither, till they were so lucky as to discover an open window in some forgotten corner. Through this they vanished, and were seen no more.
At last, when the princess and her ladies had been forced to leave the upper rooms, where the walls and floors had melted away, and to take refuge in the hall, the young man came home. He had ridden back along a winding road from which he did not see the palace till he was close upon it, and stood horrified at the spectacle before him. He knew in an instant that his wife must have betrayed his trust, but he would not fight her, as she must be suffering enough already. Hurrying on he sprang over all that was left of the palace walls, and the princess gave a cry of relief at the sight of him.
‘Come quickly,’ he said, ‘or you will be frozen to death!’ And a dreary little procession set out for the king’s palace, the greyhound and the cat bringing up the rear.
At the gates he left them, though his wife besought him to allow her to enter.
‘You have betrayed me and ruined me,’ he said sternly; ‘I go to seek my fortune alone.’ And without another word he turned and left her.
With his falcon on his wrist, and his greyhound and cat behind him, the young man walked a long way, inquiring of everyone he met whether they had seen his enemy the ogre. But nobody had. Then he bade his falcon fly up into the sky–up, up, and up–and try if his sharp eyes could discover the old thief. The bird had to go so high that he did not return for some hours; but he told his master that the ogre was lying asleep in a splendid palace in a far country on the shores of the sea. This was delightful news to the young man, who instantly bought some meat for the falcon, bidding him to have a good meal.
‘Tomorrow,’ said he, ‘you will fly to the palace where the ogre lies, and while he is asleep you will search all about him for a stone on which is engraved strange signs; this you will bring to me. In three days I shall expect you back here.’
‘Well, I must take the cat with me,’ answered the bird.
The sun had not yet risen before the falcon soared high into the air, the cat seated on his back, with his paws tightly clasping the bird’s neck.
‘You had better shut your eyes or you may get dizzy,’ said the bird; and the cat, you had never before been off the ground except to climb a tree, did as she was bid.
All that day and all that night they flew, and in the morning they saw the ogre’s palace lying beneath them.
‘Dear me,’ said the cat, opening her eyes for the first time, ‘that looks to me very like a rat city down there, let us go down to it; they may be able to help us.’ So they alighted in some bushes in the heart of the rat city. The falcon remained where he was, but the cat lay down outside the principal gate, causing terrible excitement among the rats.
At length, seeing she did not move, one bolder than the rest put its head out of an upper window of the castle, and said, in a trembling voice:
‘Why have you come here? What do you want? If it is anything in our power, tell us, and we will do it.’
‘If you would have let me speak to you before, I would have told you that I come as a friend,’ replied the cat; ‘and I shall be greatly obliged if you would send four of the strongest and cleverest among you, to do me a service.’
‘Oh, we shall be delighted,’ answered the rat, much relieved. ‘But if you will inform me what it is you wish them to do I shall be better able to judge who is most fitted for the post.’
‘I thank you,’ said the cat. ‘Well, what they have to do is this: Tonight they must burrow under the walls of the castle and go up to the room were an ogre lies asleep. Somewhere about him he has hidden a stone, on which are engraved strange signs. When they have found it they must take it from him without his waking, and bring it to me.’
‘Your orders shall be obeyed,’ replied the rat. And he went out to give his instructions.
About midnight the cat, who was still sleeping before the gate, was awakened by some water flung at her by the head rat, who could not make up his mind to open the doors.
‘Here is the stone you wanted,’ said he, when the cat started up with a loud mew; ‘if you will hold up your paws I will drop it down.’ And so he did. ‘And now farewell,’ continued the rat; ‘you have a long way to go, and will do well to start before daybreak.’
‘Your counsel is good,’ replied the cat, smiling to itself; and putting the stone in her mouth she went off to seek the falcon.
Now all this time neither the cat nor the falcon had had any food, and the falcon soon got tired carrying such a heavy burden. When night arrived he declared he could go no further, but would spend it on the banks of a river.
‘And it is my turn to take care of the stone,’ said he, ‘or it will seem as if you had done everything and I nothing.’
‘No, I got it, and I will keep it,’ answered the cat, who was tired and cross; and they began a fine quarrel. But, unluckily, in the midst of it, the cat raised her voice, and the stone fell into the ear of a big fish which happened to be swimming by, and though both the cat and the falcon sprang into the water after it, they were too late.
Half drowned, and more than half choked, the two faithful servants scrambled back to land again. The falcon flew to a tree and spread his wings in the sun to dry, but the cat, after giving herself a good shake, began to scratch up the sandy banks and to throw the bits into the stream.
‘What are you doing that for?’ asked a little fish. ‘Do you know that you are making the water quite muddy?’
‘That doesn’t matter at all to me,’ answered the cat. ‘I am going to fill up all the river, so that the fishes may die.’
‘That is very unkind, as we have never done you any harm,’ replied the fish. ‘Why are you so angry with us?’
‘Because one of you has got a stone of mine– a stone with strange signs upon it–which dropped into the water. If you will promise to get it back for me, why, perhaps I will leave your river alone.’
‘I will certainly try,’ answered the fish in a great hurry; ‘but you must have a little patience, as it may not be an easy task.’ And in an instant his scales might be seen flashing quickly along.
The fish swam as fast as he could to the sea, which was not far distant, and calling together all his relations who lived in the neighbourhood, he told them of the terrible danger which threatened the dwellers in the river.
‘None of us has got it,’ said the fishes, shaking their heads; ‘but in the bay yonder there is a tuna who, although he is so old, always goes everywhere. He will be able to tell you about it, if anyone can.’ So the little fish swam off to the tuna, and again related his story.
‘Why I was up that river only a few hours ago!’ cried the tuna; ‘and as I was coming back something fell into my ear, and there it is still, for I went to sleep, when I got home and forgot all about it. Perhaps it may be what you want.’ And stretching up his tail he whisked out the stone.
‘Yes, I think that must be it,’ said the fish with joy. And taking the stone in his mouth he carried it to the place where the cat was waiting for him.
‘I am much obliged to you,’ said the cat, as the fish laid the stone on the sand, ‘and to reward you, I will let your river alone.’ And she mounted the falcon’s back, and they flew to their master.
Ah, how glad he was to see them again with the magic stone in their possession. In a moment he had wished for a palace, but this time it was of green marble; and then he wished for the princess and her ladies to occupy it. And there they lived for many years, and when the old king died the princess’s husband reigned in his stead.

Once upon a time there lived a man who had seven daughters. For a long time they dwelt quite happily at home together, then one morning the father called them all before him and said:
‘Your mother and I are going on a journey, and as we do not know how long we may be away, you will find enough provisions in the house to last you three years. But see you do not open the door to anyone till we come home again.’
‘Very well, dear father,’ replied the girls.
For two years they never left the house or unlocked the door; but one day, when they had washed their clothes, and were spreading them out on the roof to dry, the girls looked down into the street where people were walking to and fro, and across to the market, with its stalls of fresh meat, vegetables, and other nice things.
‘Come here,’ cried one. ‘It makes me quite hungry! Why should not we have our share? Let one of us go to the market, and buy meat and vegetables.’
‘Oh, we mustn’t do that!’ said the youngest. ‘You know our father forbade us to open the door till he came home again.’
Then the eldest sister sprang at her and struck her, the second spit at her, the third abused her, the fourth pushed her, the fifth flung her to the ground, and the sixth tore her clothes. Then they left her lying on the floor, and went out with a basket.
In about an hour they came back with the basket full of meat and vegetables, which they put in a pot, and set on the fire, quite forgetting that the house door stood wide open. The youngest sister, however, took no part in all this, and when dinner was ready and the table laid, she stole softly out to the entrance hall, and hid herself behind a great cask which stood in one corner.
Now, while the other sisters were enjoying their feast, a witch passed by, and catching sight of the open door, she walked in. She went up to the eldest girl, and said: ‘Where shall I begin on you, you fat bolster?’
‘You must begin,’ answered she, ‘with the hand which struck my little sister.’
So the witch gobbled her up, and when the last scrap had disappeared, she came to the second and asked: ‘Where shall I begin on you, my fat bolster?’
And the second answered, ‘You must begin on my mouth, which spat on my sister.’
And so on to the rest; and very soon the whole six had disappeared. And as the witch was eating the last mouthful of the last sister, the youngest, who had been crouching, frozen with horror, behind the barrel, ran out through the open door into the street. Without looking behind her, she hastened on and on, as fast as her feet would carry her, till she saw an ogre’s castle standing in front of her. In a corner near the door she spied a large pot, and she crept softly up to it and pulled the cover over it, and went to sleep.
By-and-by the ogre came home. ‘Fee, Fo, Fum,’ cried he, ‘I smell the smell of a man. What ill fate has brought him here?’ And he looked through all the rooms, and found nobody. ‘Where are you?’ he called. ‘Do not be afraid, I will do you no harm.’
But the girl was still silent.
‘Come out, I tell you,’ repeated the ogre. ‘Your life is quite safe. If you are an old man, you shall be my father. If you are a boy, you shall be my son. If your years are as many as mine, you shall be my brother. If you are an old woman, you shall be my mother. If you are a young one, you shall be my daughter. If you are middle-aged, you shall be my wife. So come out, and fear nothing.’
Then the maiden came out of her hiding-place, and stood before him.
‘Fear nothing,’ said the ogre again; and when he went away to hunt he left her to look after the house. In the evening he returned, bringing with him hares, partridges, and gazelles, for the girl’s supper; for himself he only cared for the flesh of men, which she cooked for him. He also gave into her charge the keys of six rooms, but the key of the seventh he kept himself.
And time passed on, and the girl and the ogre still lived together.
She called him ‘Father,’ and he called her ‘Daughter,’ and never once did he speak roughly to her.
One day the maiden said to him, ‘Father, give me the key of the upper chamber.’
‘No, my daughter,’ replied the ogre. ‘There is nothing there that is any use to you.’
‘But I want the key,’ she repeated again.
However the ogre took no notice, and pretended not to hear. The girl began to cry, and said to herself: ‘To-night, when he thinks I am asleep, I will watch and see where he hides it;’ and after she and the ogre had supped, she bade him good-night, and left the room. In a few minutes she stole quietly back, and watched from behind a curtain. In a little while she saw the ogre take the key from his pocket, and hide it in a hole in the ground before he went to bed. And when all was still she took out the key, and went back to the house.
The next morning the ogre awoke with the first ray of light, and the first thing he did was to look for the key. It was gone, and he guessed at once what had become of it.
But instead of getting into a great rage, as most ogres would have done, he said to himself, ‘If I wake the maiden up I shall only frighten her. For to-day she shall keep the key, and when I return to-night it will be time enough to take it from her.’ So he went off to hunt.
The moment he was safe out of the way, the girl ran upstairs and opened the door of the room, which was quite bare. The one window was closed, and she threw back the lattice and looked out. Beneath lay a garden which belonged to the prince, and in the garden was an ox, who was drawing up water from the well all by himself—for there was nobody to be seen anywhere. The ox raised his head at the noise the girl made in opening the lattice, and said to her, ‘Good morning, O daughter of Buk Ettemsuch! Your father is feeding you up till you are nice and fat, and then he will put you on a spit and cook you.’
These words so frightened the maiden that she burst into tears and ran out of the room. All day she wept, and when the ogre came home at night, no supper was ready for him.
‘What are you crying for?’ said he. ‘Where is my supper, and is it you who have opened the upper chamber?’
‘Yes, I opened it,’ answered she.
‘And what did the ox say to you?’
‘He said, “Good morning, O daughter of Buk Ettemsuch. Your father is feeding you up till you are nice and fat, and then he will put you on a spit and cook you.”’
‘Well, to-morrow you can go to the window and say, “My father is feeding me up till I am nice and fat, but he does not mean to eat me. If I had one of your eyes I would use it for a mirror, and look at myself before and behind; and your girths should be loosened, and you should be blind—seven days and seven nights.”’
‘All right,’ replied the girl, and the next morning, when the ox spoke to her, she answered him as she had been told, and he fell down straight upon the ground, and lay there seven days and seven nights. But the flowers in the garden withered, for there was no one to water them.
When the prince came into his garden he found nothing but yellow stalks; in the midst of them the ox was lying. With a blow from his sword he killed the animal, and, turning to his attendants, he said, ‘Go and fetch another ox!’ And they brought in a great beast, and he drew the water out of the well, and the flowers revived, and the grass grew green again. Then the prince called his attendants and went away.
The next morning the girl heard the noise of the waterwheel, and she opened the lattice and looked out of the window.
‘Good morning, O daughter of Buk Ettemsuch!’ said the new ox. ‘Your father is feeding you up till you are nice and fat, and then he will put you on a spit and cook you.’
And the maiden answered: ‘My father is feeding me up till I am nice and fat, but he does not mean to eat me. If I had one of your eyes I would use it for a mirror, and look at myself before and behind; and your girths should be loosened, and you should be blind—seven days and seven nights.’
Directly she uttered these words the ox fell to the ground and lay there, seven days and seven nights. Then he arose and began to draw the water from the well. He had only turned the wheel once or twice, when the prince took it into his head to visit his garden and see how the new ox was getting on. When he entered the ox was working busily; but in spite of that the flowers and grass were dried up. And the prince drew his sword, and rushed at the ox to slay him, as he had done the other. But the ox fell on his knees and said:
‘My lord, only spare my life, and let me tell you how it happened.’
‘How what happened?’ asked the prince.
‘My lord, a girl looked out of that window and spoke a few words to me, and I fell to the ground. For seven days and seven nights I lay there, unable to move. But, O my lord, it is not given to us twice to behold beauty such as hers.’
‘It is a lie,’ said the prince. ‘An ogre dwells there. Is it likely that he keeps a maiden in his upper chamber?’
‘Why not?’ replied the ox. ‘But if you come here at dawn to-morrow, and hide behind that tree, you will see for yourself.’
‘So I will,’ said the prince; ‘and if I find that you have not spoken truth, I will kill you.’
The prince left the garden, and the ox went on with his work. Next morning the prince came early to the garden, and found the ox busy with the waterwheel.
‘Has the girl appeared yet?’ he asked.
‘Not yet; but she will not be long. Hide yourself in the branches of that tree, and you will soon see her.’
The prince did as he was told, and scarcely was he seated when the maiden threw open the lattice.
‘Good morning, O daughter of Buk Ettemsuch!’ said the ox. ‘Your father is feeding you up till you are nice and fat, and then he will put you on a spit and cook you.’
‘My father is feeding me up till I am nice and fat, but he does not mean to eat me. If I had one of your eyes I would use it for a mirror, and look at myself before and behind; and your girths should be loosened, and you should be blind—seven days and seven nights.’ And hardly had she spoken when the ox fell on the ground, and the maiden shut the lattice and went away. But the prince knew that what the ox had said was true, and that she had not her equal in the whole world. And he came down from the tree, his heart burning with love.
‘Why has the ogre not eaten her?’ thought he. ‘This night I will invite him to supper in my palace and question him about the maiden, and find out if she is his wife.’
So the prince ordered a great ox to be slain and roasted whole, and two huge tanks to be made, one filled with water and the other with wine. And towards evening he called his attendants and went to the ogre’s house to wait in the courtyard till he came back from hunting. The ogre was surprised to see so many people assembled in front of his house; but he bowed politely and said, ‘Good morning, dear neighbours! To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit? I have not offended you, I hope?’
‘Oh, certainly not!’ answered the prince.
‘Then,’ continued the ogre, ‘What has brought you to my house to-day for the first time?’
‘We should like to have supper with you,’ said the prince.
‘Well, supper is ready, and you are welcome,’ replied the ogre, leading the way into the house, for he had had a good day, and there was plenty of game in the bag over his shoulder.
A table was quickly prepared, and the prince had already taken his place, when he suddenly exclaimed, ‘After all, Buk Ettemsuch, suppose you come to supper with me?’
‘Where?’ asked the ogre.
‘In my house. I know it is all ready.’
‘But it is so far off—why not stay here?’
‘Oh, I will come another day; but this evening I must be your host.’
So the ogre accompanied the prince and his attendants back to the palace. After a while the prince turned to the ogre and said:
‘It is as a wooer that I appear before you. I seek a wife from an honourable family.’
‘But I have no daughter,’ replied the ogre.
‘Oh, yes you have, I saw her at the window.’
‘Well, you can marry her if you wish,’ said he.
So the prince’s heart was glad as he and his attendants rode back with the ogre to his house. And as they parted, the prince said to his guest, ‘You will not forget the bargain we have made?’
‘I am not a young man, and never break my promises,’ said the ogre, and went in and shut the door.
Upstairs he found the maiden, waiting till he returned to have her supper, for she did not like eating by herself.
‘I have had my supper,’ said the ogre, ‘for I have been spending the evening with the prince.’
‘Where did you meet him?’ asked the girl.
‘Oh, we are neighbours, and grew up together, and to-night I promised that you should be his wife.’
‘I don’t want to be any man’s wife,’ answered she; but this was only pretence, for her heart too was glad.
Next morning early came the prince, bringing with him bridal gifts, and splendid wedding garments, to carry the maiden back to his palace.
But before he let her go the ogre called her to him, and said, ‘Be careful, girl, never to speak to the prince; and when he speaks to you, you must be dumb, unless he swears “by the head of Buk Ettemsuch.” Then you may speak.’
‘Very well,’ answered the girl.
They set out; and when they reached the palace, the prince led his bride to the room he had prepared for her, and said ‘Speak to me, my wife,’ but she was silent; and by-and-by he left her, thinking that perhaps she was shy. The next day the same thing happened, and the next.
At last he said, ‘Well, if you won’t speak, I shall go and get another wife who will.’ And he did.
Now when the new wife was brought to the palace the daughter of Buk Ettemsuch rose, and spoke to the ladies who had come to attend on the second bride. ‘Go and sit down. I will make ready the feast.’ And the ladies sat down as they were told, and waited.
The maiden sat down too, and called out, ‘Come here, firewood,’ and the firewood came. ‘Come here, fire,’ and the fire came and kindled the wood. ‘Come here, pot.’ ‘Come here, oil;’ and the pot and the oil came. ‘Get into the pot, oil!’ said she, and the oil did it. When the oil was boiling, the maiden dipped all her fingers in it, and they became ten fried fishes. ‘Come here, oven,’ she cried next, and the oven came. ‘Fire, heat the oven.’ And the fire heated it. When it was hot enough, the maiden jumped in, just as she was, with her beautiful silver and gold dress, and all her jewels. In a minute or two she had turned into a snow-white loaf, that made your mouth water.
Said the loaf to the ladies, ‘You can eat now; do not stand so far off;’ but they only stared at each other, speechless with surprise.
‘What are you staring at?’ asked the new bride.
‘At all these wonders,’ replied the ladies.
‘Do you call these wonders?’ said she scornfully; ‘I can do that too,’ and she jumped straight into the oven, and was burnt up in a moment.
Then they ran to the prince and said: ‘Come quickly, your wife is dead!’
‘Bury her, then!’ returned he. ‘But why did she do it? I am sure I said nothing to make her throw herself into the oven.’
Accordingly the burnt woman was buried, but the prince would not go to the funeral as all his thoughts were still with the wife who would not speak to him. The next night he said to her, ‘Dear wife, are you afraid that something dreadful will happen if you speak to me? If you still persist in being dumb, I shall be forced to get another wife.’ The poor girl longed to speak, but dread of the ogre kept her silent, and the prince did as he had said, and brought a fresh bride into the palace. And when she and her ladies were seated in state, the maiden planted a sharp stake in the ground, and sat herself down comfortably on it, and began to spin.
‘What are you staring at so?’ said the new bride to her ladies. ‘Do you think that is anything wonderful? Why, I can do as much myself!’
‘I am sure you can’t,’ said they, much too surprised to be polite.
Then the maid sprang off the stake and left the room, and instantly the new wife took her place. But the sharp stake ran through, and she was dead in a moment. So they sent to the prince and said, ‘Come quickly, and bury your wife.’
‘Bury her yourselves,’ he answered. ‘What did she do it for? It was not by my orders that she impaled herself on the stake.’
So they buried her; and in the evening the prince came to the daughter of Buk Ettemsuch, and said to her, ‘Speak to me, or I shall have to take another wife.’ But she was afraid to speak to him.
The following day the prince hid himself in the room and watched. And soon the maiden woke, and said to the pitcher and to the water-jug, ‘Quick! go down to the spring and bring me some water; I am thirsty.’
And they went. But as they were filling themselves at the spring, the water-jug knocked against the pitcher and broke off its spout. And the pitcher burst into tears, and ran to the maiden, and said: ‘Mistress, beat the water-jug, for he has broken my spout!’
‘By the head of Buk Ettemsuch, I implore you not to beat me!’
‘Ah,’ she replied, ‘if only my husband had sworn by that oath, I could have spoken to him from the beginning, and he need never have taken another wife. But now he will never say it, and he will have to go on marrying fresh ones.’
And the prince, from his hiding-place, heard her words, and he jumped up and ran to her and said, ‘By the head of Buk Ettemsuch, speak to me.’
So she spoke to him, and they lived happily to the end of their days, because the girl kept the promise she had made to the ogre.

Once upon a time there lived a man whose name was Abu Nowas, and he was a great favourite with the Sultan of the country, who had a palace in the same town where Abu Nowas dwelt.
One day Abu Nowas came weeping into the hall of the palace where the Sultan was sitting, and said to him: ‘Oh, mighty Sultan, my wife is dead.’
‘That is bad news,’ replied the Sultan; ‘I must get you another wife.’ And he bade his Grand Vizir send for the Sultana.
‘This poor Abu Nowas has lost his wife,’ said he, when she entered the hall.
‘Oh, then we must get him another,’ answered the Sultana; ‘I have a girl that will suit him exactly,’ and clapped her hands loudly. At this signal a maiden appeared and stood before her.
‘I have got a husband for you,’ said the Sultana.
‘Who is he?’ asked the girl.
‘Abu Nowas, the jester,’ replied the Sultana.
‘I will take him,’ answered the maiden; and as Abu Nowas made no objection, it was all arranged. The Sultana had the most beautiful clothes made for the bride, and the Sultan gave the bridegroom his wedding suit, and a thousand gold pieces into the bargain, and soft carpets for the house.
So Abu Nowas took his wife home, and for some time they were very happy, and spent the money freely which the Sultan had given them, never thinking what they should do for more when that was gone. But come to an end it did, and they had to sell their fine things one by one, till at length nothing was left but a cloak apiece, and one blanket to cover them. ‘We have run through our fortune,’ said Abu Nowas, ‘what are we to do now? I am afraid to go back to the Sultan, for he will command his servants to turn me from the door. But you shall return to your mistress, and throw yourself at her feet and weep, and perhaps she will help us.’
‘Oh, you had much better go,’ said the wife. ‘I shall not know what to say.’
‘Well, then, stay at home, if you like,’ answered Abu Nowas, ‘and I will ask to be admitted to the Sultan’s presence, and will tell him, with sobs, that my wife is dead, and that I have no money for her burial. When he hears that perhaps he will give us something.’
‘Yes, that is a good plan,’ said the wife; and Abu Nowas set out.
The Sultan was sitting in the hall of justice when Abu Nowas entered, his eyes streaming with tears, for he had rubbed some pepper into them. They smarted dreadfully, and he could hardly see to walk straight, and everyone wondered what was the matter with him.
‘Abu Nowas! What has happened?’ cried the Sultan.
‘Oh, noble Sultan, my wife is dead,’ wept he.
‘We must all die,’ answered the Sultan; but this was not the reply for which Abu Nowas had hoped.
‘True, O Sultan, but I have neither shroud to wrap her in, nor money to bury her with,’ went on Abu Nowas, in no wise abashed by the way the Sultan had received his news.
‘Well, give him a hundred pieces of gold,’ said the Sultan, turning to the Grand Vizir. And when the money was counted out Abu Nowas bowed low, and left the hall, his tears still flowing, but with joy in his heart.
‘Have you got anything?’ cried his wife, who was waiting for him anxiously.
‘Yes, a hundred gold pieces,’ said he, throwing down the bag, ‘but that will not last us any time. Now you must go to the Sultana, clothed in sackcloth and robes of mourning, and tell her that your husband, Abu Nowas, is dead, and you have no money for his burial. When she hears that, she will be sure to ask you what has become of the money and the fine clothes she gave us on our marriage, and you will answer, “before he died he sold everything.”’
The wife did as she was told, and wrapping herself in sackcloth went up to the Sultana’s own palace, and as she was known to have been one of Subida’s favourite attendants, she was taken without difficulty into the private apartments.
‘What is the matter?’ inquired the Sultana, at the sight of the dismal figure.
‘My husband lies dead at home, and he has spent all our money, and sold everything, and I have nothing left to bury him with,’ sobbed the wife.
Then Subida took up a purse containing two hundred gold pieces, and said: ‘Your husband served us long and faithfully. You must see that he has a fine funeral.’
The wife took the money, and, kissing the feet of the Sultana, she joyfully hastened home. They spent some happy hours planning how they should spend it, and thinking how clever they had been. ‘When the Sultan goes this evening to Subida’s palace,’ said Abu Nowas, ‘she will be sure to tell him that Abu Nowas is dead. “Not Abu Nowas, it is his wife,” he will reply, and they will quarrel over it, and all the time we shall be sitting here enjoying ourselves. Oh, if they only knew, how angry they would be!’
As Abu Nowas had foreseen, the Sultan went, in the evening after his business was over, to pay his usual visit to the Sultana.
‘Poor Abu Nowas is dead!’ said Subida when he entered the room.
‘It is not Abu Nowas, but his wife who is dead,’ answered the Sultan.
‘No; really you are quite wrong. She came to tell me herself only a couple of hours ago,’ replied Subida, ‘and as he had spent all their money, I gave her something to bury him with.’
‘You must be dreaming,’ exclaimed the Sultan. ‘Soon after midday Abu Nowas came into the hall, his eyes streaming with tears, and when I asked him the reason he answered that his wife was dead, and they had sold everything they had, and he had nothing left, not so much as would buy her a shroud, far less for her burial.’
For a long time they talked, and neither would listen to the other, till the Sultan sent for the door-keeper and bade him go instantly to the house of Abu Nowas and see if it was the man or his wife who was dead. But Abu Nowas happened to be sitting with his wife behind the latticed window, which looked on the street, and he saw the man coming, and sprang up at once. ‘There is the Sultan’s door-keeper! They have sent him here to find out the truth. Quick! throw yourself on the bed and pretend that you are dead.’ And in a moment the wife was stretched out stiffly, with a linen sheet spread across her, like a corpse.
She was only just in time, for the sheet was hardly drawn across her when the door opened and the porter came in. ‘Has anything happened?’ asked he.
‘My poor wife is dead,’ replied Abu Nowas. ‘Look! she is laid out here.’ And the porter approached the bed, which was in a corner of the room, and saw the stiff form lying underneath.
‘We must all die,’ said he, and went back to the Sultan.
‘Well, have you found out which of them is dead?’ asked the Sultan.
‘Yes, noble Sultan; it is the wife,’ replied the porter.
‘He only says that to please you,’ cried Subida in a rage; and calling to her chamberlain, she ordered him to go at once to the dwelling of Abu Nowas and see which of the two was dead. ‘And be sure you tell the truth about it,’ added she, ‘or it will be the worse for you.’
As her chamberlain drew near the house, Abu Nowas caught sight of him. ‘There is the Sultana’s chamberlain,’ he exclaimed in a fright. ‘Now it is my turn to die. Be quick and spread the sheet over me.’ And he laid himself on the bed, and held his breath when the chamberlain came in. ‘What are you weeping for?’ asked the man, finding the wife in tears.
‘My husband is dead,’ answered she, pointing to the bed; and the chamberlain drew back the sheet and beheld Abu Nowas lying stiff and motionless. Then he gently replaced the sheet and returned to the palace.
‘Well, have you found out this time?’ asked the Sultan.
‘My lord, it is the husband who is dead.’
‘But I tell you he was with me only a few hours ago,’ cried the Sultan angrily. ‘I must get to the bottom of this before I sleep! Let my golden coach be brought round at once.’
The coach was before the door in another five minutes, and the Sultan and Sultana both got in. Abu Nowas had ceased being a dead man, and was looking into the street when he saw the coach coming. ‘Quick! quick!’ he called to his wife. ‘The Sultan will be here directly, and we must both be dead to receive him.’ So they laid themselves down, and spread the sheet over them, and held their breath. At that instant the Sultan entered, followed by the Sultana and the chamberlain, and he went up to the bed and found the corpses stiff and motionless. ‘I would give a thousand gold pieces to anyone who would tell me the truth about this,’ cried he, and at the words Abu Nowas sat up. ‘Give them to me, then,’ said he, holding out his hand. ‘You cannot give them to anyone who needs them more.’
‘Oh, Abu Nowas, you impudent dog!’ exclaimed the Sultan, bursting into a laugh, in which the Sultana joined. ‘I might have known it was one of your tricks!’ But he sent Abu Nowas the gold he had promised, and let us hope that it did not fly so fast as the last had done.

Once upon a time there lived a man who had nearly as many children as there were sparrows in the garden. He had to work very hard all day to get them enough to eat, and was often tired and cross, and abused everything and everybody, so that people called him ‘Father Grumbler.’
By-and-by he grew weary of always working, and on Sundays he lay a long while in bed, instead of going to church. Then after a time he found it dull to sit so many hours by himself, thinking of nothing but how to pay the rent that was owing, and as the tavern across the road looked bright and cheerful, he walked in one day and sat down with his friends. ‘It was just to chase away Care,’ he said; but when he came out, hours and hours after, Care came out with him.
Father Grumbler entered his house feeling more dismal than when he left it, for he knew that he had wasted both his time and his money.
‘I will go and see the Holy Man in the cave near the well,’ he said to himself, ‘and perhaps he can tell me why all the luck is for other people, and only misfortunes happen to me.’ And he set out at once for the cave.
It was a long way off, and the road led over mountains and through valleys; but at last he reached the cave where the Holy Man dwelt, and knocked at the door.
‘Who is there?’ asked a voice from within.
‘It is I, Holy Man, Father Grumbler, you know, who has as many children as sparrows in the garden.’
‘Well, and what is it that you want?’
‘I want to know why other people have all the luck, and only misfortunes happen to me!’
The Holy Man did not answer, but went into an inner cave, from which he came out bearing something in his hand. ‘Do you see this basket?’ said he. ‘It is a magical basket, and if you are hungry you have only got to say: “Little basket, little basket, do your duty,” and you will eat the best dinner you ever had in your life. But when you have had enough, be sure you don’t forget to cry out: “That will do for to-day.” Oh!–and one thing more–you need not show it to everybody and declare that I have give it to you. Do you understand?’
Father Grumbler was always accustomed to think of himself as so unlucky that he did not know whether the Holy Man was not playing a trick upon him; but he took the basket without being polite enough to say either ‘Thank you,’ or ‘Good-morning,’ and went away. However, he only waited till he was out of sight of the cave before he stooped down and whispered: ‘Little basket, little basket, do your duty.’
Now the basket had a lid, so that he could not see what was inside, but he heard quite clearly strange noises, as if a sort of scuffling was going on. Then the lid burst open, and a quantity of delicious little white rolls came tumbling out one after the other, followed by a stream of small fishes all ready cooked. What a quantity there were to be sure! The whole road was covered with them, and the banks on each side were beginning to disappear. Father Grumbler felt quite frightened at the torrent, but at last he remembered what the Holy Man had told him, and cried at the top of his voice: ‘Enough! enough! That will do for to-day!’ And the lid of the basket closed with a snap.
Father Grumbler sighed with relief and happiness as he looked around him, and sitting down on a heap of stones, he ate till he could eat no more. Trout, salmon, turbot, soles, and a hundred other fishes whose names he did not know, lay boiled, fried, and grilled within reach of his hands. As the Holy Man had said, he had never eaten such a dinner; still, when he had done, he shook his head, and grumbled; ‘Yes, there is plenty to eat, of course, but it only makes me thirsty, and there is not a drop to drink anywhere.’
Yet, somehow, he could never tell why, he looked up and saw the tavern in front of him, which he thought was miles, and miles, and miles away.
‘Bring the best wine you have got, and two glasses, good mother,’ he said as he entered, ‘and if you are fond of fish there is enough here to feed the house. Only there is no need to chatter about it all over the place. You understand? Eh?’ And without waiting for an answer he whispered to the basket: ‘Little basket, little basket, do your duty.’ The innkeeper and his wife thought that their customer had gone suddenly mad, and watched him closely, ready to spring on him if he became violent; but both instinctively jumped backwards, nearly into the fire, as rolls and fishes of every kind came tumbling out of the basket, covering the tables and chairs and the floor, and even overflowing into the street.
‘Be quick, be quick, and pick them up,’ cried the man. ‘And if these are not enough, there are plenty more to be had for the asking.’
The innkeeper and his wife did not need telling twice. Down they went on their knees and gathered up everything they could lay hands on. But busy though they seemed, they found time to whisper to each other:
‘If we can only get hold of that basket it will make our fortune!’
So they began by inviting Father Grumbler to sit down to the table, and brought out the best wine in the cellar, hoping it might loosen his tongue. But Father Grumbler was wiser than they gave him credit for, and though they tried in all manner of ways to find out who had given him the basket, he put them off, and kept his secret to himself. Unluckily, though he did not SPEAK, he did drink, and it was not long before he fell fast asleep. Then the woman fetched from her kitchen a basket, so like the magic one that no one, without looking very closely, could tell the difference, and placed it in Father Grumbler’s hand, while she hid the other carefully away.
It was dinner time when the man awoke, and, jumping up hastily, he set out for home, where he found all the children gathered round a basin of thin soup, and pushing their wooden bowls forward, hoping to have the first spoonful. Their father burst into the midst of them, bearing his basket, and crying:
‘Don’t spoil your appetites, children, with that stuff. Do you see this basket? Well, I have only got to say, “Little basket, little basket, do your duty,” and you will see what will happen. Now you shall say it instead of me, for a treat.’
The children, wondering and delighted, repeated the words, but nothing happened. Again and again they tried, but the basket was only a basket, with a few scales of fish sticking to the bottom, for the innkeeper’s wife had taken it to market the day before.
‘What is the matter with the thing?’ cried the father at last, snatching the basket from them, and turning it all over, grumbling and swearing while he did so, under the eyes of his astonished wife and children, who did not know whether to cry or to laugh.
‘It certainly smells of fish,’ he said, and then he stopped, for a sudden thought had come to him.
‘Suppose it is not mine at all; supposing– Ah, the scoundrels!’
And without listening to his wife and children, who were frightened at his strange conduct and begged him to stay at home, he ran across to the tavern and burst open the door.
‘Can I do anything for you, Father Grumbler?’ asked the innkeeper’s wife in her softest voice.
‘I have taken the wrong basket–by mistake, of course,’ said he. ‘Here is yours, will you give me back my own?’
‘Why, what are you talking about?’ answered she. ‘You can see for yourself that there is no basket here.’
And though Father Grumbler DID look, it was quite true that none was to be seen.
‘Come, take a glass to warm you this cold day,’ said the woman, who was anxious to keep him in a good temper, and as this was an invitation Father Grumbler never refused, he tossed it off and left the house.
He took the road that led to the Holy Man’s cave, and made such haste that it was not long before he reached it.
‘Who is there?’ said a voice in answer to his knock.
‘It is me, it is me, Holy man. You know quite well. Father Grumbler, who has as many children as sparrows in the garden.’
‘But, my good man, it was only yesterday that I gave you a handsome present.’
‘Yes, Holy Man, and here it is. But something has happened, I don’t know what, and it won’t work any more.’
‘Well, put it down. I will go and see if I can find anything for you.’
In a few minutes the Holy Man returned with a cock under his arm.
‘Listen to me,’ he said, ‘whenever you want money, you only have to say: “Show me what you can do, cock,” and you will see some wonderful things. But, remember, it is not necessary to let all the world into the secret.’
‘Oh no, Holy Man, I am not so foolish as that.’
‘Nor to tell everybody that I gave it to you,’ went on the Holy Man. ‘I have not got these treasures by the dozen.’
And without waiting for an answer he shut the door.
As before, the distance seemed to have wonderfully shortened, and in a moment the tavern rose up in front of Father Grumbler. Without stopping to think, he went straight in, and found the innkeeper’s wife in the kitchen making a cake.
‘Where have you come from, with that fine red cock in your basket,’ asked she, for the bird was so big that the lid would not shut down properly.
‘Oh, I come from a place where they don’t keep these things by the dozen,’ he replied, sitting down in front of the table.
The woman said no more, but set before him a bottle of his favourite wine, and soon he began to wish to display his prize.
‘Show me what you can do, cock,’ cried he. And the cock stood up and flapped his wings three times, crowing ‘coquerico’ with a voice like a trumpet, and at each crow there fell from his beak golden drops, and diamonds as large as peas.
This time Father Grumbler did not invite the innkeeper’s wife to pick up his treasures, but put his own hat under the cock’s beak, so as to catch everything he let fall; and he did not see the husband and wife exchanging glances with each other which said, ‘That would be a splendid cock to put with our basket.’
‘Have another glass of wine?’ suggested the innkeeper, when they had finished admiring the beauty of the cock, for they pretended not to have seen the gold or the diamonds. And Father Grumbler, nothing loth, drank one glass after another, till his head fell forward on the table, and once more he was sound asleep. Then the woman gently coaxed the cock from the basket and carried it off to her own poultry yard, from which she brought one exactly like it, and popped it in its place.
Night was falling when the man awoke, and throwing proudly some grains of gold on the table to pay for the wine he had drunk, he tucked the cock comfortably into his basket and set out for home.
His wife and all the children were waiting for him at the door, and as soon as she caught sight of him she broke out:
‘You are a nice man to go wasting your time and your money drinking in that tavern, and leaving us to starve! Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?’
‘You don’t know what you are talking of,’ he answered. ‘Money? Why, I have gold and diamonds now, as much as I want. Do you see that cock? Well, you have only to say to him, “Show me what you can do, cock,” and something splendid will happen.’
Neither wife nor children were inclined to put much faith in him after their last experience; however, they thought it was worth trying, and did as he told them. The cock flew round the room like a mad thing, and crowed till their heads nearly split with the noise; but no gold or diamonds dropped on the brick floor– not the tiniest grain of either.
Father Grumbler stared in silence for an instant, and then he began to swear so loudly that even his family, accustomed as they were to his language, wondered at him.
At last he grew a little quieter, but remained as puzzled as ever.
‘Can I have forgotten the words? But I KNOW that was what he said! And I saw the diamonds with my own eyes!’ Then suddenly he seized the cock, shut it into the basket, and rushed out of the house.
His heavy wooden shoes clattered as he ran along the road, and he made such haste that the stars were only just beginning to come out when he reached the cave of the Holy Man.
‘Who is that knocking?’ asked a voice from within.
‘It is me! It is me! Holy Man! you know! Father–‘
‘But, my good fellow, you really should give some one else a chance. This is the third time you have been–and at such an hour, too!’
‘Oh, yes, Holy Man, I know it is very late, but you will forgive me! It is your cock–there is something the matter. It is like the basket. Look!’
‘THAT my cock? THAT my basket? Somebody has played you a trick, my good man!’
‘A trick?’ repeated Father Grumbler, who began to understand what had happened. ‘Then it must have been those two–‘
‘I warned you not to show them to anybody,’ said the Holy Man. ‘You deserve–but I will give you one more chance.’ And, turning, he unhooked something from the wall.
‘When you wish to dust your own jacket or those of your friends,’ he said, ‘you have only got to say, “Flack, flick, switch, be quick,” and you will see what happens. That is all I have to tell you.’ And, smiling to himself, the Holy Man pushed Father Grumbler out of the cave.
‘Ah, I understand now,’ muttered the good man, as he took the road home; ‘but I think I have got you two rascals!’ and he hurried on to the tavern with his basket under his arm, and the cock and the switch both inside.
‘Good evening, friends!’ he said, as he entered the inn. ‘I am very hungry, and should be glad if you would roast this cock for me as soon as possible. THIS cock and no other–mind what I say,’ he went on. ‘Oh, and another thing! You can light the fire with this basket. When you have done that I will show you something I have in my bag,’ and, as he spoke, he tried to imitate the smile that the Holy Man had given HIM.
These directions made the innkeeper’s wife very uneasy. However, she said nothing, and began to roast the cock, while her husband did his best to make the man sleepy with wine, but all in vain.
After dinner, which he did not eat without grumbling, for the cock was very tough, the man struck his hand on the table, and said: ‘Now listen to me. Go and fetch my cock and my basket, at once. Do you hear?’
‘Your cock, and your basket, Father Grumbler? But you have just- -‘
‘MY cock and MY basket!’ interrupted he. ‘And, if you are too deaf and too stupid to understand what that means, I have got something which may help to teach you.’ And opening the bag, he cried: ‘Flack, flick, switch, be quick.’
And flack! flick! like lightening a white switch sprang out of the bag, and gave such hearty blows to the innkeeper and his wife, and to Father Grumbler into the bargain, that they all jumped as high as feathers when a mattress is shaken.
‘Stop! stop! make it stop, and you shall have back your cock and basket,’ cried the man and his wife. And Father Grumbler, who had no wish to go on, called out between his hops: ‘Stop then, can’t you? That is enough for to-day!’
But the switch paid no attention, and dealt out its blows as before, and MIGHT have been dealing them to this day, if the Holy Man had not heard their cries and come to the rescue. ‘Into the bag, quick!’ said he, and the switch obeyed.
‘Now go and fetch me the cock and the basket,’ and the woman went without a word, and placed them on the table.
‘You have all got what you deserved,’ continued the Holy Man, ‘and I have no pity for any of you. I shall take my treasures home, and perhaps some day I may find a man who knows how to make the best of the chances that are given to him. But that will never be YOU,’ he added, turning to Father Grumbler.

Once there was a man named Go′so, who taught children to read, not in a schoolhouse, but under a calabash tree. One evening, while Goso was sitting under the tree deep in the study of the next day’s lessons, Paa, the gazelle, climbed up the tree very quietly to steal some fruit, and in so doing shook off a calabash, which, in falling, struck the teacher on the head and killed him.
When his scholars came in the morning and found their teacher lying dead, they were filled with grief; so, after giving him a decent burial, they agreed among themselves to find the one who had killed Goso, and put him to death.
After talking the matter over they came to the conclusion that the south wind was the offender.
So they caught the south wind and beat it.
But the south wind cried: “Here! I am Koo′see, the south wind. Why are you beating me? What have I done?”
And they said: “Yes, we know you are Koosee; it was you who threw down the calabash that struck our teacher Goso. You should not have done it.”
But Koosee said, “If I were so powerful would I be stopped by a mud wall?”
So they went to the mud wall and beat it.
But the mud wall cried: “Here! I am Keeyambaa′za, the mud wall. Why are you beating me? What have I done?”
And they said: “Yes, we know you are Keeyambaaza; it was you who stopped Koosee, the south wind; and Koosee, the south wind, threw down the calabash that struck our teacher Goso. You should not have done it.”
But Keeyambaaza said, “If I were so powerful would I be bored through by the rat?”
So they went and caught the rat and beat it.
But the rat cried: “Here! I am Paan′ya, the rat. Why are you beating me? What have I done?”
And they said: “Yes, we know you are Paanya; it was you who bored through Keeyambaaza, the mud wall; which stopped Koosee, the south wind; and Koosee, the south wind, threw down the calabash that struck our teacher Goso. You should not have done it.”
But Paanya said, “If I were so powerful would I be eaten by a cat?”
So they hunted for the cat, caught it, and beat it.
But the cat cried: “Here! I am Paa′ka, the cat. Why do you beat me? What have I done?”
And they said: “Yes, we know you are Paaka; it is you that eats Paanya, the rat; who bores through Keeyambaaza, the mud wall; which stopped Koosee, the south wind; and Koosee, the south wind, threw down the calabash that struck our teacher Goso. You should not have done it.”
But Paaka said, “If I were so powerful would I be tied by a rope?”
So they took the rope and beat it.
But the rope cried: “Here! I am Kaam′ba, the rope. Why do you beat me? What have I done?”
And they said: “Yes, we know you are Kaamba; it is you that ties Paaka, the cat; who eats Paanya, the rat; who bores through Keeyambaaza, the mud wall; which stopped Koosee, the south wind; and Koosee, the south wind, threw down the calabash that struck our teacher Goso. You should not have done it.”
But Kaamba said, “If I were so powerful would I be cut by a knife?”
So they took the knife and beat it.
But the knife cried: “Here! I am Kee′soo, the knife. Why do you beat me? What have I done?”
And they said: “Yes, we know you are Keesoo; you cut Kaamba, the rope; that ties Paaka, the cat; who eats Paanya, the rat; who bores through Keeyambaaza, the mud wall; which stopped Koosee, the south wind; and Koosee, the south wind, threw down the calabash that struck our teacher Goso. You should not have done it.”
But Keesoo said, “If I were so powerful would I be burned by the fire?”
And they went and beat the fire.
But the fire cried: “Here! I am Mo′to, the fire. Why do you beat me? What have I done?”
And they said: “Yes, we know you are Moto; you burn Keesoo, the knife; that cuts Kaamba, the rope; that ties Paaka, the cat; who eats Paanya, the rat; who bores through Keeyambaaza, the mud wall; which stopped Koosee, the south wind; and Koosee, the south wind, threw down the calabash that struck our teacher Goso. You should not have done it.”
But Moto said, “If I were so powerful would I be put out by water?”
And they went to the water and beat it.
But the water cried: “Here! I am Maa′jee, the water. Why do you beat me? What have I done?”
And they said: “Yes, we know you are Maajee; you put out Moto, the fire; that burns Keesoo, the knife; that cuts Kaamba, the rope; that ties Paaka, the cat; who eats Paanya, the rat; who bores through Keeyambaaza, the mud wall; which stopped Koosee, the south wind; and Koosee, the south wind, threw down the calabash that struck our teacher Goso. You should not have done it.”
But Maajee said, “If I were so powerful would I be drunk by the ox?”
And they went to the ox and beat it.
But the ox cried: “Here! I am Ng’om′bay, the ox. Why do you beat me? What have I done?”
And they said: “Yes, we know you are Ng’ombay; you drink Maajee, the water; that puts out Moto, the fire; that burns Keesoo, the knife; that cuts Kaamba, the rope; that ties Paaka, the cat; who eats Paanya, the rat; who bores through Keeyambaaza, the mud wall; which stopped Koosee, the south wind; and Koosee, the south wind, threw down the calabash that struck our teacher Goso. You should not have done it.”
But Ng’ombay said, “If I were so powerful would I be tormented by the fly?”
And they caught a fly and beat it.
But the fly cried: “Here! I am Een′zee, the fly. Why do you beat me? What have I done?”
And they said: “Yes, we know you are Eenzee; you torment Ng’ombay, the ox; who drinks Maajee, the water; that puts out Moto, the fire; that burns Keesoo, the knife; that cuts Kaamba, the rope; that ties Paaka, the cat; who eats Paanya, the rat; who bores through Keeyambaaza, the mud wall; which stopped Koosee, the south wind; and Koosee, the south wind, threw down the calabash that struck our teacher Goso. You should not have done it.”
But Eenzee said, “If I were so powerful would I be eaten by the gazelle?”
And they searched for the gazelle, and when they found it they beat it.
But the gazelle said: “Here! I am Paa, the gazelle. Why do you beat me? What have I done?”
And they said: “Yes, we know you are Paa; you eat Eenzee, the fly; that torments Ng’ombay, the ox; who drinks Maajee, the water; that puts out Moto, the fire; that burns Keesoo, the knife; that cuts Kaamba, the rope; that ties Paaka, the cat; who eats Paanya, the rat; who bores through Keeyambaaza, the mud wall; which stopped Koosee, the south wind; and Koosee, the south wind, threw down the calabash that struck our teacher Goso. You should not have done it.”
The gazelle, through surprise at being found out and fear of the consequences of his accidental killing of the teacher, while engaged in stealing, was struck dumb.
Then the scholars said: “Ah! he hasn’t a word to say for himself. This is the fellow who threw down the calabash that struck our teacher Goso. We will kill him.”
So they killed Paa, the gazelle, and avenged the death of their teacher.

Already a member?Sign in. OrCreatea free Fairytalez account in less than a minute.
Far away in a hot country, where the forests are very thick and dark, and the rivers very swift and strong, there once lived a strange pair of friends. Now one of the friends was a big white rabbit named Isuro, and the other was a tall baboon called Gudu, and so fond were they of each other that they were seldom seen apart.
One day, when the sun was hotter even than usual, the rabbit awoke from his midday sleep, and saw Gudu the baboon standing beside him.
‘Get up,’ said Gudu; ‘I am going courting, and you must come with me. So put some food in a bag, and sling it round your neck, for we may not be able to find anything to eat for a long while.’
Then the rabbit rubbed his eyes, and gathered a store of fresh green things from under the bushes, and told Gudu that he was ready for the journey.
They went on quite happily for some distance, and at last they came to a river with rocks scattered here and there across the stream.
‘We can never jump those wide spaces if we are burdened with food,’ said Gudu, ‘we must throw it into the river, unless we wish to fall in ourselves.’ And stooping down, unseen by Isuro, who was in front of him, Gudu picked up a big stone, and threw it into the water with a loud splash.
‘It is your turn now,’ he cried to Isuro. And with a heavy sigh, the rabbit unfastened his bag of food, which fell into the river.
The road on the other side led down an avenue of trees, and before they had gone very far Gudu opened the bag that lay hidden in the thick hair about his neck, and began to eat some delicious-looking fruit.
‘Where did you get that from?’ asked Isuro enviously.
‘Oh, I found after all that I could get across the rocks quite easily, so it seemed a pity not to keep my bag,’ answered Gudu.
‘Well, as you tricked me into throwing away mine, you ought to let me share with you,’ said Isuro. But Gudu pretended not to hear him, and strode along the path.
By-and-bye they entered a wood, and right in front of them was a tree so laden with fruit that its branches swept the ground. And some of the fruit was still green, and some yellow. The rabbit hopped forward with joy, for he was very hungry; but Gudu said to him: ‘Pluck the green fruit, you will find it much the best. I will leave it all for you, as you have had no dinner, and take the yellow for myself.’ So the rabbit took one of the green oranges and began to bite it, but its skin was so hard that he could hardly get his teeth through the rind.
‘It does not taste at all nice,’ he cried, screwing up his face; ‘I would rather have one of the yellow ones.’
‘No! no! I really could not allow that,’ answered Gudu. ‘They would only make you ill. Be content with the green fruit.’ And as they were all he could get, Isuro was forced to put up with them.
After this had happened two or three times, Isuro at last had his eyes opened, and made up his mind that, whatever Gudu told him, he would do exactly the opposite. However, by this time they had reached the village where dwelt Gudu’s future wife, and as they entered Gudu pointed to a clump of bushes, and said to Isuro: ‘Whenever I am eating, and you hear me call out that my food has burnt me, run as fast as you can and gather some of those leaves that they may heal my mouth.’
The rabbit would have liked to ask him why he ate food that he knew would burn him, only he was afraid, and just nodded in reply; but when they had gone on a little further, he said to Gudu:
‘I have dropped my needle; wait here a moment while I go and fetch it.’
‘Be quick then,’ answered Gudu, climbing into a tree. And the rabbit hastened back to the bushes, and gathered a quantity of the leaves, which he hid among his fur, ‘For,’ thought he, ‘if I get them now I shall save myself the trouble of a walk by-and-by.’
When he had plucked as many as he wanted he returned to Gudu, and they went on together.
The sun was almost setting by the time they reached their journey’s end and being very tired they gladly sat down by a well. Then Gudu’s betrothed, who had been watching for him, brought out a pitcher of water–which she poured over them to wash off the dust of the road–and two portions of food. But once again the rabbit’s hopes were dashed to the ground, for Gudu said hastily:
‘The custom of the village forbids you to eat till I have finished.’ And Isuro did not know that Gudu was lying, and that he only wanted more food. So he saw hungrily looking on, waiting till his friend had had enough.
In a little while Gudu screamed loudly: ‘I am burnt! I am burnt!’ though he was not burnt at all. Now, though Isuro had the leaves about him, he did not dare to produce them at the last moment lest the baboon should guess why he had stayed behind. So he just went round a corner for a short time, and then came hopping back in a great hurry. But, quick though he was, Gudu had been quicker still, and nothing remained but some drops of water.
‘How unlucky you are,’ said Gudu, snatching the leaves; ‘no sooner had you gone than ever so many people arrived, and washed their hands, as you see, and ate your portion.’ But, though Isuro knew better than to believe him, he said nothing, and went to bed hungrier than he had ever been in his life.
Early next morning they started for another village, and passed on the way a large garden where people were very busy gathering monkey- nuts.
‘You can have a good breakfast at last,’ said Gudu, pointing to a heap of empty shells; never doubting but that Isuro would meekly take the portion shown him, and leave the real nuts for himself. But what was his surprise when Isuro answered:
‘Thank you; I think I should prefer these.’ And, turning to the kernels, never stopped as long as there was one left. And the worst of it was that, with so many people about, Gudu could not take the nuts from him.
It was night when they reached the village where dwelt the mother of Gudu’s betrothed, who laid meat and millet porridge before them.
‘I think you told me you were fond of porridge,’ said Gudu; but Isuro answered: ‘You are mistaking me for somebody else, as I always eat meat when I can get it.’ And again Gudu was forced to be content with the porridge, which he hated.
While he was eating it, however a sudden thought darted into his mind, and he managed to knock over a great pot of water which was hanging in front of the fire, and put it quite out.
‘Now,’ said the cunning creature to himself, ‘I shall be able in the dark to steal his meat!’ But the rabbit had grown as cunning as he, and standing in a corner hid the meat behind him, so that the baboon could not find it.
‘O Gudu!’ he cried, laughing aloud, ‘it is you who have taught me to be clever.’ And calling to the people of the house, he bade them kindle the fire, for Gudu would sleep by it, but that he would pass the night with some friends in another hut.
It was still quite dark when Isuro heard his name called very softly, and, on opening his eyes, beheld Gudu standing by him. Laying his finger on his nose, in token of silence, he signed to Isuro to get up and follow him, and it was not until they were some distance from the hut that Gudu spoke.
‘I am hungry and want something to eat better than that nasty porridge that I had for supper. So I am going to kill one of those goats, and as you are a good cook you must boil the flesh for me.’ The rabbit nodded, and Gudu disappeared behind a rock, but soon returned dragging the dead goat with him. The two then set about skinning it, after which they stuffed the skin with dried leaves, so that no one would have guessed it was not alive, and set it up in the middle of a lump of bushes, which kept it firm on its feet. While he was doing this, Isuro collected sticks for a fire, and when it was kindled, Gudu hastened to another hut to steal a pot which he filled with water from the river, and, planting two branches in the ground, they hung the pot with the meat in it over the fire.
‘It will not be fit to eat for two hours at least,’ said Gudu, ‘so we can both have a nap.’ And he stretched himself out on the ground, and pretended to fall fast asleep, but, in reality, he was only waiting till it was safe to take all the meat for himself. ‘Surely I hear him snore,’ he thought; and he stole to the place where Isuro was lying on a pile of wood, but the rabbit’s eyes were wide open.
‘How tiresome,’ muttered Gudu, as he went back to his place; and after waiting a little longer he got up, and peeped again, but still the rabbit’s pink eyes stared widely. If Gudu had only known, Isuro was asleep all the time; but this he never guessed, and by-and- bye he grew so tired with watching that he went to sleep himself. Soon after, Isuro woke up, and he too felt hungry, so he crept softly to the pot and ate all the meat, while he tied the bones together and hung them in Gudu’s fur. After that he went back to the wood-pile and slept again.
In the morning the mother of Gudu’s betrothed came out to milk her goats, and on going to the bushes where the largest one seemed entangled, she found out the trick. She made such lament that the people of the village came running, and Gudu and Isuro jumped up also, and pretended to be as surprised and interested as the rest. But they must have looked guilty after all, for suddenly an old man pointed to them, and cried:
‘Those are thieves.’ And at the sound of his voice the big Gudu trembled all over.
‘How dare you say such things? I defy you to prove it,’ answered Isuro boldly. And he danced forward, and turned head over heels, and shook himself before them all.
‘I spoke hastily; you are innocent,’ said the old man; ‘but now let the baboon do likewise.’ And when Gudu began to jump the goat’s bones rattled and the people cried: ‘It is Gudu who is the goat-slayer!’ But Gudu answered:
‘Nay, I did not kill your goat; it was Isuro, and he ate the meat, and hung the bones round my neck. So it is he who should die!’ And the people looked at each other, for they knew not what to believe. At length one man said:
‘Let them both die, but they may choose their own deaths.’
Then Isuro answered:
‘If we must die, put us in the place where the wood is cut, and heap it up all round us, so that we cannot escape, and set fire to the wood; and if one is burned and the other is not, then he that is burned is the goat- slayer.’
And the people did as Isuro had said. But Isuro knew of a hole under the wood-pile, and when the fire was kindled he ran into the hole, but Gudu died there.
When the fire had burned itself out and only ashes were left where the wood had been, Isuro came out of his hole, and said to the people:
‘Lo! did I not speak well? He who killed your goat is among those ashes.’

A long time ago a little town made up of a collection of low huts stood in a tiny green valley at the foot of a cliff. Of course the people had taken great care to build their houses out of reach of the highest tide which might be driven on shore by a west wind, but on the very edge of the town there had sprung up a tree so large that half its boughs hung over the huts and the other half over the deep sea right under the cliff, where sharks loved to come and splash in the clear water. The branches of the tree itself were laden with fruit, and every day at sunrise a big grey monkey might have been seen sitting in the topmost branches having his breakfast, and chattering to himself with delight.
After he had eaten all the fruit on the town side of the tree the monkey swung himself along the branches to the part which hung over the water. While he was looking out for a nice shady place where he might perch comfortably he noticed a shark watching him from below with greedy eyes.
‘Can I do anything for you, my friend?’ asked the monkey politely.
‘Oh! if you only would thrown me down some of those delicious things, I should be so grateful,’ answered the shark. ‘After you have lived on fish for fifty years you begin to feel you would like a change. And I am so very, very tired of the taste of salt.’
‘Well, I don’t like salt myself,’ said the monkey; ‘so if you will open your mouth I will throw this beautiful juicy kuyu into it,’ and, as he spoke, he pulled one off the branch just over his head. But it was not so easy to hit the shark’s mouth as he supposed, even when the creature had turned on his back, and the first kuyu only struck one of his teeth and rolled into the water. However, the second time the monkey had better luck, and the fruit fell right in.
‘Ah, how good!’ cried the shark. ‘Send me another, please.’ And the monkey grew tired of picking the kuyu long before the shark was tired of eating them.
‘It is getting late, and I must be going home to my children,’ he said, at length, ‘but if you are here at the same time to-morrow I will give you another treat.’
‘Thank you, thank you,’ said the shark, showing all his great ugly teeth as he grinned with delight; ‘you can’t guess how happy you have made me,’ and he swam away into the shadow, hoping to sleep away the time till the monkey came again.
For weeks the monkey and the shark breakfasted together, and it was a wonder that the tree had any fruit left for them. They became fast friends, and told each other about their homes and their children, and how to teach them all they ought to know. By and bye the monkey became rather discontented with his green house in a grove of palms beyond the town, and longed to see the strange things under the sea which he had heard of from the shark. The shark perceived this very clearly, and described greater marvels, and the monkey as he listened grew more and more gloomy.
Matters were in this state when one day the shark said: ‘I really hardly know how to thank you for all your kindness to me during these weeks. Here I have nothing of my own to offer you, but if you would only consent to come home with me, how gladly would I give you anything that might happen to take your fancy.’
‘I should like nothing better,’ cried the monkey, his teeth chattering, as they always did when he was pleased. ‘But how could I get there? Not by water. Ugh! It makes me ill to think of it!’
‘Oh! don’t let that trouble you,’ replied the shark, ‘you have only to sit on my back and I will undertake that not a drop of water shall touch you.’
So it was arranged, and directly after breakfast next morning the shark swam close up under the tree and the monkey dropped neatly on his back, without even a splash. After a few minutes–for at first he felt a little frightened at his strange position–the monkey began to enjoy himself vastly, and asked the shark a thousand questions about the fish and the sea-weeds and the oddly-shaped things that floated past them, and as the shark always gave him some sort of answer, the monkey never guessed that many of the objects they saw were as new to his guide as to himself.
The sun had risen and set six times when the shark suddenly said, ‘My friend, we have now performed half our journey, and it is time that I should tell you something.’
‘What is it?’ asked the monkey. ‘Nothing unpleasant, I hope, for you sound rather grave?’
‘Oh, no! Nothing at all. It is only that shortly before we left I heard that the sultan of my country is very ill, and that the only thing to cure him is a monkey’s heart.’
‘Poor man, I am very sorry for him,’ replied the monkey; ‘but you were unwise not to tell me till we had started.’
‘What do you mean?’ asked the shark; but the monkey, who now understood the whole plot, did not answer at once, for he was considering what he should say.
‘Why are you so silent?’ inquired the shark again.
‘I was thinking what a pity it was you did not tell me while I was still on land, and then I would have brought my heart with me.’
‘Your heart! Why isn’t your heart here?’ said the shark, with a puzzled expression.
‘Oh, no! Of course not. Is it possible you don’t know that when we leave home we always hang up our hearts on trees, to prevent their being troublesome? However, perhaps you won’t believe that, and will just think I have invented it because I am afraid, so let us go on to your country as fast as we can, and when we arrive you can look for my heart, and if you find it you can kill me.’
The monkey spoke in such a calm, indifferent way that the shark was quite deceived, and began to wish he had not been in such a hurry.
‘But there is no use going on if your heart is not with you,’ he said at last. ‘We had better turn back to the town, and then you can fetch it.’
Of course, this was just what the monkey wanted, but he was careful not to seem too pleased.
‘Well, I don’t know,’ he remarked carelessly, ‘it is such a long way; but you may be right.’
‘I am sure I am,’ answered the shark, ‘and I will swim as quickly as I can,’ and so he did, and in three days they caught sight of the kuyu tree hanging over the water.
With a sigh of relief the monkey caught hold of the nearest branch and swung himself up.
‘Wait for me here,’ he called out to the shark. ‘I am so hungry I must have a little breakfast, and then I will go and look for my heart,’ and he went further and further into the branches so that the shark could not see him. Then he curled himself up and went to sleep.
‘Are you there?’ cried the shark, who was soon tired of swimming about under the cliff, and was in haste to be gone.
The monkey awoke with a start, but did not answer.
‘Are you there?’ called the shark again, louder than before, and in a very cross voice.
‘Oh, yes. I am here,’ replied the monkey; ‘but I wish you had not wakened me up. I was having such a nice nap.’
‘Have you got it?’ asked the shark. ‘It is time we were going.’
‘Going where?’ inquired the monkey.
‘Why, to my country, of course, with your heart. You CAN’T have forgotten!’
‘My dear friend,’ answered the monkey, with a chuckle, ‘I think you must be going a little mad. Do you take me for a washerman’s donkey?’
‘Don’t talk nonsense,’ exclaimed the shark, who did not like being laughed at. ‘What do you mean about a washerman’s donkey? And I wish you would be quick, or we may be too late to save the sultan.’
‘Did you really never hear of the washerman’s donkey?’ asked the monkey, who was enjoying himself immensely. ‘Why, he is the beast who has no heart. And as I am not feeling very well, and am afraid to start while the sun is so high lest I should get a sunstroke, if you like, I will come a little nearer and tell you his story.’
‘Very well,’ said the shark sulkily, ‘if you won’t come, I suppose I may as well listen to that as do nothing.’
So the monkey began.
‘A washerman once lived in the great forest on the other side of the town, and he had a donkey to keep him company and to carry him wherever he wanted to go. For a time they got on very well, but by and bye the donkey grew lazy and ungrateful for her master’s kindness, and ran away several miles into the heart of the forest, where she did nothing but eat and eat and eat, till she grew so fat she could hardly move.
‘One day as she was tasting quite a new kind of grass and wondering if it was as good as what she had had for dinner the day before, a hare happened to pass by.
‘”Well, that is a fat creature,” thought she, and turned out of her path to tell the news to a lion who was a friend of hers. Now the lion had been very ill, and was not strong enough to go hunting for himself, and when the hare came and told him that a very fat donkey was to be found only a few hundred yards off, tears of disappointment and weakness filled his eyes.
‘”What is the good of telling me that?” he asked, in a weepy voice; “you know I cannot even walk as far as that palm.”
‘”Never mind,” answered the hare briskly. “If you can’t go to your dinner your dinner shall come to you,” and nodding a farewell to the lion she went back to the donkey.
‘”Good morning,” said she, bowing politely to the donkey, who lifted her head in surprise. “Excuse my interrupting you, but I have come on very important business.”
‘”Indeed,” answered the donkey, “it is most kind of you to take the trouble. May I inquire what the business is?”
‘”Certainly,” replied the hare. “It is my friend the lion who has heard so much of your charms and good qualities that he has sent me to beg that you will give him your paw in marriage. He regrets deeply that he is unable to make the request in person, but he has been ill and is too weak to move.”
‘”Poor fellow! How sad!” said the donkey. “But you must tell him that I feel honoured by his proposal, and will gladly consent to be Queen of the Beasts.”
‘”Will you not come and tell him so yourself?” asked the hare.
‘Side by side they went down the road which led to the lion’s house. It took a long while, for the donkey was so fat with eating she could only walk very slowly, and the hare, who could have run the distance in about five minutes, was obliged to creep along till she almost dropped with fatigue at not being able to go at her own pace. When at last they arrived the lion was sitting up at the entrance, looking very pale and thin. The donkey suddenly grew shy and hung her head, but the lion put on his best manners and invited both his visitors to come in and make themselves comfortable.
‘Very soon the hare got up and said, “Well, as I have another engagement I will leave you to make acquaintance with your future husband,” and winking at the lion she bounded away.
‘The donkey expected that as soon as they were left alone the lion would begin to speak of their marriage, and where they should live, but as he said nothing she looked up. To her surprise and terror she saw him crouching in the corner, his eyes glaring with a red light, and with a loud roar he sprang towards her. But in that moment the donkey had had time to prepare herself, and jumping on one side dealt the lion such a hard kick that he shrieked with the pain. Again and again he struck at her with his claws, but the donkey could bite too, as well as the lion, who was very weak after his illness, and at last a well- planted kick knocked him right over, and he rolled on the floor, groaning with pain. The donkey did not wait for him to get up, but ran away as fast as she could and was lost in the forest.
‘Now the hare, who knew quite well what would happen, had not gone to do her business, but hid herself in some bushes behind the cave, where she could hear quite clearly the sounds of the battle. When all was quiet again she crept gently out, and stole round the corner.
‘”Well, lion, have you killed her?” asked she, running swiftly up the path.
‘”Killed her, indeed!” answered the lion sulkily, “it is she who has nearly killed me. I never knew a donkey could kick like that, though I took care she should carry away the marks of my claws.”
‘”Dear me! Fancy such a great fat creature being able to fight!” cried the hare. “But don’t vex yourself. Just lie still, and your wounds will soon heal,” and she bade her friend, good bye, and returned to her family.
‘Two or three weeks passed, and only bare places on the donkey’s back showed where the lion’s claws had been, while, on his side, the lion had recovered from his illness and was now as strong as ever. He was beginning to think that it was almost time for him to begin hunting again, when one morning a rustle was heard in the creepers outside, and the hare’s head peeped through.
‘”Ah! there is no need to ask how you are,” she said. “Still you mustn’t overtire yourself, you know. Shall I go and bring you your dinner?”
‘”If you will bring me that donkey I will tear it in two,” cried the lion savagely, and the hare laughed and nodded and went on her errand.
‘This time the donkey was much further than before, and it took longer to find her. At last the hare caught sight of four hoofs in the air, and ran towards them. The donkey was lying on a soft cool bed of moss near a stream, rolling herself backwards and forwards from pleasure.
‘”Good morning,” said the hare politely, and the donkey got slowly on to her legs, and looked to see who her visitor could be.
‘”Oh, it is you, is it?” she exclaimed. “Come and have a chat. What news have you got?”
‘”I mustn’t stay,” answered the hare; “but I promised the lion to beg you to pay him a visit, as he is not well enough to call on you.”
‘”Well, I don’t know,” replied the donkey gloomily, “the last time we went he scratched me very badly, and really I was quite afraid.”
‘”He was only trying to kiss you,” said the hare, “and you bit him, and of course that made him cross.”
‘”If I were sure of that,” hesitated the donkey.
‘”Oh, you may be quite sure,” laughed the hare. “I have a large acquaintance among lions. But let us be quick,” and rather unwillingly the donkey set out.
‘The lion saw them coming and hid himself behind a large tree. As the donkey went past, followed by the hare, he sprang out, and with one blow of his paw stretched the poor foolish creature dead before him.
‘”Take this meat and skin it and roast it,” he said to the hare; “but my appetite is not so good as it was, and the only part I want for myself is the heart. The rest you can either eat yourself or give away to your friends.”
‘”Thank you,” replied the hare, balancing the donkey on her back as well as she was able, and though the legs trailed along the ground she managed to drag it to an open space some distance off, where she made a fire and roasted it. As soon as it was cooked the hare took out the heart and had just finished eating it when the lion, who was tired of waiting, came up.
‘”I am hungry,” said he. “Bring me the creature’s heart; it is just what I want for supper.”
‘”But there is no heart,” answered the hare, looking up at the lion with a puzzled face.
‘”What nonsense!” said the lion. “As if every beast had not got a heart. What do you mean?”
‘”This is a washerman’s donkey,” replied the hare gravely.
‘”Well, and suppose it is?”
‘”Oh, fie!” exclaimed the hare. “You, a lion and a grown-up person, and ask questions like that. If the donkey had had a heart would she be here now? The first time she came she knew you were trying to kill her, and ran away. Yet she came back a second time. Well, if she had had a heart would she have come back a second time? Now would she?”
‘And the lion answered slowly, “No, she would not.”
‘So you think I am a washerman’s donkey?’ said the monkey to the shark, when the story was ended. ‘You are wrong; I am not. And as the sun is getting low in the sky, it is time for you to begin your homeward journey. You will have a nice cool voyage, and I hope you will find the sultan better. Farewell!’ And the monkey disappeared among the green branches, and was gone.

Once there was a very poor man, named Haamdaa′nee, who begged from door to door for his living, sometimes taking things before they were offered him. After a while people became suspicious of him, and stopped giving him anything, in order to keep him away from their houses. So at last he was reduced to the necessity of going every morning to the village dust heap, and picking up and eating the few grains of the tiny little millet seed that he might find there.
One day, as he was scratching and turning over the heap, he found a dime, which he tied up in a corner of his ragged dress, and continued to hunt for millet grains, but could not find one.
“Oh, well,” said he, “I’ve got a dime now; I’m pretty well fixed. I’ll go home and take a nap instead of a meal.”
So he went to his hut, took a drink of water, put some tobacco in his mouth, and went to sleep.
The next morning, as he scratched in the dust heap, he saw a countryman going along, carrying a basket made of twigs, and he called to him: “Hi, there, countryman! What have you in that cage?”
The countryman, whose name was Moohaad′eem, replied, “Gazelles.”
And Haamdaanee called: “Bring them here. Let me see them.”
Now there were three well-to-do men standing near; and when they saw the countryman coming to Haamdaanee they smiled, and said, “You’re taking lots of trouble for nothing, Moohaadeem.”
“How’s that, gentlemen?” he inquired.
“Why,” said they, “that poor fellow has nothing at all. Not a cent.”
“Oh, I don’t know that,” said the countryman; “he may have plenty, for all I know.”
“Not he,” said they.
“Don’t you see for yourself,” continued one of them, “that he is on the dust heap? Every day he scratches there like a hen, trying to get enough grains of millet to keep himself alive. If he had any money, wouldn’t he buy a square meal, for once in his life? Do you think he would want to buy a gazelle? What would he do with it? He can’t find enough food for himself, without looking for any for a gazelle.”
But Moohaadeem said: “Gentlemen, I have brought some goods here to sell. I answer all who call me, and if any one says ‘Come,’ I go to him. I don’t favor one and slight another; therefore, as this man called me, I’m going to him.”
“All right,” said the first man; “you don’t believe us. Well, we know where he lives, and all about him, and we know that he can’t buy anything.”
“That’s so,” said the second man. “Perhaps, however, you will see that we were right, after you have a talk with him.”
To which the third man added, “Clouds are a sign of rain, but we have seen no signs of his being about to spend any money.”
“All right, gentlemen,” said Moohaadeem; “many better-looking people than he call me, and when I show them my gazelles they say, ‘Oh, yes, they’re very beautiful, but awfully dear; take them away.’ So I shall not be disappointed if this man says the same thing. I shall go to him, anyhow.”
Then one of the three men said, “Let us go with this man, and see what the beggar will buy.”
“Pshaw!” said another; “buy! You talk foolishly. He has not had a good meal in three years, to my knowledge; and a man in his condition doesn’t have money to buy gazelles. However, let’s go; and if he makes this poor countryman carry his load over there just for the fun of looking at the gazelles, let each of us give him a good hard whack with our walking-sticks, to teach him how to behave toward honest merchants.”
So, when they came near him, one of those three men said: “Well, here are the gazelles; now buy one. Here they are, you old hypocrite; you’ll feast your eyes on them, but you can’t buy them.”
But Haamdaanee, paying no attention to the men, said to Moohaadeem, “How much for one of your gazelles?”
Then another of those men broke in: “You’re very innocent, aren’t you? You know, as well as I do, that gazelles are sold every day at two for a quarter.”
Still taking no notice of these outsiders, Haamdaanee continued, “I’d like to buy one for a dime.”
“One for a dime!” laughed the men; “of course you’d like to buy one for a dime. Perhaps you’d also like to have the dime to buy with.”
Then one of them gave him a push on the cheek.
At this Haamdaanee turned and said: “Why do you push me on the cheek, when I’ve done nothing to you? I do not know you. I call this man, to transact some business with him, and you, who are strangers, step in to spoil our trade.”
He then untied the knot in the corner of his ragged coat, produced the dime, and, handing it to Moohaadeem, said, “Please, good man, let me have a gazelle for that.”
At this, the countryman took a small gazelle out of the cage and handed it to him, saying, “Here, master, take this one. I call it Keejee′paa.” Then turning to those three men, he laughed, and said: “Ehe! How’s this? You, with your white robes, and turbans, and swords, and daggers, and sandals on your feet—you gentlemen of property, and no mistake—you told me this man was too poor to buy anything; yet he has bought a gazelle for a dime, while you fine fellows, I think, haven’t enough money among you to buy half a gazelle, if they were five cents each.”
Then Moohaadeem and the three men went their several ways.
As for Haamdaanee, he stayed at the dust heap until he found a few grains of millet for himself and a few for Keejeepaa, the gazelle, and then went to his hut, spread his sleeping mat, and he and the gazelle slept together.
This going to the dust heap for a few grains of millet and then going home to bed continued for about a week.
Then one night Haamdaanee was awakened by some one calling, “Master!” Sitting up, he answered: “Here I am. Who calls?” The gazelle answered, “I do!”
Upon this, the beggar man became so scared that he did not know whether he should faint or get up and run away.
Seeing him so overcome, Keejeepaa asked, “Why, master, what’s the matter?”
“Oh, gracious!” he gasped; “what a wonder I see!”
“A wonder?” said the gazelle, looking all around; “why, what is this wonder, that makes you act as if you were all broken up?”
“Why, it’s so wonderful, I can hardly believe I’m awake!” said his master. “Who in the world ever before knew of a gazelle that could speak?”
“Oho!” laughed Keejeepaa; “is that all? There are many more wonderful things than that. But now, listen, while I tell you why I called you.”
“Certainly; I’ll listen to every word,” said the man. “I can’t help listening!”
“Well, you see, it’s just this way,” said Keejeepaa; “I’ve allowed you to become my master, and I can not run away from you; so I want you to make an agreement with me, and I will make you a promise, and keep it.”
“Say on,” said his master.
“Now,” continued the gazelle, “one doesn’t have to be acquainted with you long, in order to discover that you are very poor. This scratching a few grains of millet from the dust heap every day, and managing to subsist upon them, is all very well for you—you’re used to it, because it’s a matter of necessity with you; but if I keep it up much longer, you won’t have any gazelle—Keejeepaa will die of starvation. Therefore, I want to go away every day and feed on my own kind of food; and I promise you I will return every evening.”
“Well, I guess I’ll have to give my consent,” said the man, in no very cheerful tone.
As it was now dawn, Keejeepaa jumped up and ran out of the door, Haamdaanee following him. The gazelle ran very fast, and his master stood watching him until he disappeared. Then tears started in the man’s eyes, and, raising his hands, he cried, “Oh, my mother!” Then he cried, “Oh, my father!” Then he cried, “Oh, my gazelle! It has run away!”
Some of his neighbors, who heard him carrying on in this manner, took the opportunity to inform him that he was a fool, an idiot, and a dissipated fellow.
Said one of them: “You hung around that dust heap, goodness knows how long, scratching like a hen, till fortune gave you a dime. You hadn’t sense enough to go and buy some decent food; you had to buy a gazelle. Now you’ve let the creature run away. What are you crying about? You brought all your trouble on yourself.”
All this, of course, was very comforting to Haamdaanee, who slunk off to the dust heap, got a few grains of millet, and came back to his hut, which now seemed meaner and more desolate than ever.
At sunset, however, Keejeepaa came trotting in; and the beggar was happy again, and said, “Ah, my friend, you have returned to me.”
“Of course,” said the gazelle; “didn’t I promise you? You see, I feel that when you bought me you gave all the money you had in the world, even though it was only a dime. Why, then, should I grieve you? I couldn’t do it. If I go and get myself some food, I’ll always come back evenings.”
When the neighbors saw the gazelle come home every evening and run off every morning, they were greatly surprised, and began to suspect that Haamdaanee was a wizard.
Well, this coming and going continued for five days, the gazelle telling its master each night what fine places it had been to, and what lots of food it had eaten.
On the sixth day it was feeding among some thorn bushes in a thick wood, when, scratching away some bitter grass at the foot of a big tree, it saw an immense diamond of intense brightness.
“Oho!” said Keejeepaa, in great astonishment; “here’s property, and no mistake! This is worth a kingdom! If I take it to my master he will be killed; for, being a poor man, if they say to him, ‘Where did you get it?’ and he answers, ‘I picked it up,’ they will not believe him; if he says, ‘It was given to me,’ they will not believe him either. It will not do for me to get my master into difficulties. I know what I’ll do. I’ll seek some powerful person; he will use it properly.”
So Keejeepaa started off through the forest, holding the diamond in his mouth, and ran, and ran, but saw no town that day; so he slept in the forest, and arose at dawn and pursued his way. And the second day passed like the first.
On the third day the gazelle had traveled from dawn until between eight and nine o’clock, when he began to see scattered houses, getting larger in size, and knew he was approaching a town. In due time he found himself in the main street of a large city, leading direct to the sultan’s palace, and began to run as fast as he could. People passing along stopped to look at the strange sight of a gazelle running swiftly along the main street with something wrapped in green leaves between its teeth.
The sultan was sitting at the door of his palace, when Keejeepaa, stopping a little way off, dropped the diamond from its mouth, and, lying down beside it, panting, called out: “Ho, there! Ho, there!” which is a cry every one makes in that part of the world when wishing to enter a house, remaining outside until the cry is answered.
After the cry had been repeated several times, the sultan said to his attendants, “Who is doing all that calling?”
And one answered, “Master, it’s a gazelle that’s calling, ‘Ho, there!’”
“Ho-ho!” said the sultan; “Ho-ho! Invite the gazelle to come near.”
Then three attendants ran to Keejeepaa and said: “Come, get up. The sultan commands you to come near.”
So the gazelle arose, picked up the diamond, and, approaching the sultan, laid the jewel at his feet, saying, “Master, good afternoon!” To which the sultan replied: “May God make it good! Come near.”
The sultan ordered his attendants to bring a carpet and a large cushion, and desired the gazelle to rest upon them. When it protested that it was comfortable as it was, he insisted, and Keejeepaa had to allow himself to be made a very honored guest. Then they brought milk and rice, and the sultan would hear nothing until the gazelle had fed and rested.
At last, when everything had been disposed of, the sultan said, “Well, now, my friend, tell me what news you bring.”
And Keejeepaa said: “Master, I don’t exactly know how you will like the news I bring. The fact is, I’m sent here to insult you! I’ve come to try and pick a quarrel with you! In fact, I’m here to propose a family alliance with you!”
At this the sultan exclaimed: “Oh, come! for a gazelle, you certainly know how to talk! Now, the fact of it is, I’m looking for some one to insult me. I’m just aching to have some one pick a quarrel with me. I’m impatient for a family alliance. Go on with your message.”
Then Keejeepaa said, “You don’t bear any ill will against me, who am only a messenger?”
And the sultan said, “None at all.”
“Well,” said Keejeepaa, “look at this pledge I bring;” dropping the diamond wrapped in leaves into the sultan’s lap.
When the sultan opened the leaves and saw the great, sparkling jewel, he was overcome with astonishment. At last he said, “Well?”
“I have brought this pledge,” said the gazelle, “from my master, Sultan Daaraa′ee. He has heard that you have a daughter, so he sent you this jewel, hoping you will forgive him for not sending something more worthy of your acceptance than this trifle.”
“Goodness!” said the sultan to himself; “he calls this a trifle!” Then to the gazelle: “Oh, that’s all right; that’s all right. I’m satisfied. The Sultan Daaraaee has my consent to marry my daughter, and I don’t want a single thing from him. Let him come empty-handed. If he has more of these trifles, let him leave them at home. This is my message, and I hope you will make it perfectly clear to your master.”
The gazelle assured him that he would explain everything satisfactorily, adding: “And now, master, I take my leave. I go straight to our own town, and hope that in about eleven days we shall return to be your guests.” So, with mutual compliments, they parted.
In the meantime, Haamdaanee was having an exceedingly tough time. Keejeepaa having disappeared, he wandered about the town moaning, “Oh, my poor gazelle! my poor gazelle!” while the neighbors laughed and jeered at him, until, between them and his loss, he was nearly out of his mind.
But one evening, when he had gone to bed, Keejeepaa walked in. Up he jumped, and began to embrace the gazelle, and weep over it, and carry on at a great rate.
When he thought there had been about enough of this kind of thing, the gazelle said: “Come, come; keep quiet, my master. I’ve brought you good news.” But the beggar man continued to cry and fondle, and declare that he had thought his gazelle was dead.
At last Keejeepaa said: “Oh, well, master, you see I’m all right. You must brace up, and prepare to hear my news, and do as I advise you.”
“Go on; go on,” replied his master; “explain what you will, I’ll do whatever you require me to do. If you were to say, ‘Lie down on your back, that I may roll you over the side of the hill,’ I would lie down.”
“Well,” said the gazelle, “there is not much to explain just now, but I’ll tell you this: I’ve seen many kinds of food, food that is desirable and food that is objectionable, but this food I’m about to offer you is very sweet indeed.”
“What?” said Haamdaanee. “Is it possible that in this world there is anything that is positively good? There must be good and bad in everything. Food that is both sweet and bitter is good food, but if food were nothing but sweetness would it not be injurious?”
“H’m!” yawned the gazelle; “I’m too tired to talk philosophy. Let’s go to sleep now, and when I call you in the morning, all you have to do is to get up and follow me.”
So at dawn they set forth, the gazelle leading the way, and for five days they journeyed through the forest.
On the fifth day they came to a stream, and Keejeepaa said to his master, “Lie down here.” When he had done so, the gazelle set to and beat him so soundly that he cried out: “Oh, let up, I beg of you!”
“Now,” said the gazelle, “I’m going away, and when I return I expect to find you right here; so don’t you leave this spot on any account.” Then he ran away, and about ten o’clock that morning he arrived at the house of the sultan.
Now, ever since the day Keejeepaa left the town, soldiers had been placed along the road to watch for and announce the approach of Sultan Daaraaee; so one of them, when he saw the gazelle in the distance, rushed up and cried to the sultan, “Sultan Daaraaee is coming! I’ve seen the gazelle running as fast as it can in this direction.”
The sultan and his attendants immediately set out to meet his guests; but when they had gone a little way beyond the town they met the gazelle coming along alone, who, on reaching the sultan, said, “Good day, my master.” The sultan replied in kind, and asked the news, but Keejeepaa said: “Ah, do not ask me. I can scarcely walk, and my news is bad!”
“Why, how is that?” asked the sultan.
“Oh, dear!” sighed the gazelle; “such misfortune and misery! You see, Sultan Daaraaee and I started alone to come here, and we got along all right until we came to the thick part of the forest yonder, when we were met by robbers, who seized my master, bound him, beat him, and took everything he had, even stripping off every stitch of his clothing. Oh, dear! oh, dear!”
“Dear me!” said the sultan; “we must attend to this at once.” So, hurrying back with his attendants to his house, he called a groom, to whom he said, “Saddle the best horse in my stable, and put on him my finest harness.” Then he directed a woman servant to open the big inlaid chest and bring him a bag of clothes. When she brought it he picked out a loin-cloth, and a long white robe, and a black overjacket, and a shawl for the waist, and a turban cloth, all of the very finest. Then he sent for a curved sword with a gold hilt, and a curved dagger with gold filigree, and a pair of elegant sandals, and a fine walking-cane.
Then the sultan said to Keejeepaa, “Take some of my soldiers, and let them convey these things to Sultan Daaraaee, that he may dress himself and come to me.”
But the gazelle answered: “Ah, my master, can I take these soldiers with me and put Sultan Daaraaee to shame? There he lies, beaten and robbed, and I would not have any one see him. I can take everything by myself.”
“Why,” exclaimed the sultan, “here is a horse, and there are clothes and arms. I don’t see how a little gazelle can manage all those things.”
But the gazelle had them fasten everything on the horse’s back, and tie the end of the bridle around his own neck, and then he set off alone, amidst the wonder and admiration of the people of that city, high and low.
When he arrived at the place where he had left the beggar-man, he found him lying waiting for him, and overjoyed at his return.
“Now,” said he, “I have brought you the sweet food I promised. Come, get up and bathe yourself.”
With the hesitation of a person long unaccustomed to such a thing, the man stepped into the stream and began to wet himself a little.
“Oh,” said the gazelle, impatiently, “a little water like that won’t do you much good; get out into the deep pool.”
“Dear me!” said the man, timidly; “there is so much water there; and where there is much water there are sure to be horrible animals.”
“Animals! What kind of animals?”
“Well, crocodiles, water lizards, snakes, and, at any rate, frogs; and they bite people, and I’m terribly afraid of all of them.”
“Oh, well,” said Keejeepaa, “do the best you can in the stream; but rub yourself well with earth, and, for goodness’ sake, scrub your teeth well with sand; they are awfully dirty.”
So the man obeyed, and soon made quite a change in his appearance.
Then the gazelle said: “Here, hurry up and put on these things. The sun has gone down, and we ought to have started before this.”
So the man dressed himself in the fine clothes the sultan had sent, and then he mounted the horse, and they started; the gazelle trotting on ahead.
When they had gone some distance, the gazelle stopped, and said, “See here: nobody who sees you now would suspect that you are the man who scratched in the dust heap yesterday. Even if we were to go back to our town the neighbors would not recognize you, if it were only for the fact that your face is clean and your teeth are white. Your appearance is all right, but I have a caution to give you. Over there, where we are going, I have procured for you the sultan’s daughter for a wife, with all the usual wedding gifts. Now, you must keep quiet. Say nothing except, ‘How d’ye do?’ and ‘What’s the news?’ Let me do the talking.”
“All right,” said the man; “that suits me exactly.”
“Do you know what your name is?”
“Of course I do.”
“Indeed? Well, what is it?”
“Why, my name is Haamdaanee.”
“Not much,” laughed Keejeepaa; “your name is Sultan Daaraaee.”
“Oh, is it?” said his master. “That’s good.”
So they started forward again, and in a little while they saw soldiers running in every direction, and fourteen of these joined them to escort them. Then they saw ahead of them the sultan, and the vizirs, and the emirs, and the judges, and the great men of the city, coming to meet them.
“Now, then,” said Keejeepaa, “get off your horse and salute your father-in-law. That’s him in the middle, wearing the sky-blue jacket.”
“All right,” said the man, jumping off his horse, which was then led by a soldier.
So the two met, and the sultans shook hands, and kissed each other, and walked up to the palace together.
Then they had a great feast, and made merry and talked until night, at which time Sultan Daaraaee and the gazelle were put into an inner room, with three soldiers at the door to guard and attend upon them.
When the morning came, Keejeepaa went to the sultan and said: “Master, we wish to attend to the business which brought us here. We want to marry your daughter, and the sooner the ceremony takes place, the better it will please the Sultan Daaraaee.”
“Why, that’s all right,” said the sultan; “the bride is ready. Let some one call the teacher, Mwaalee′moo, and tell him to come at once.”
When Mwaaleemoo arrived, the sultan said, “See here, we want you to marry this gentleman to my daughter right away.”
“All right; I’m ready,” said the teacher. So they were married.
Early the next morning the gazelle said to his master: “Now I’m off on a journey. I shall be gone about a week; but however long I am gone, don’t you leave the house till I return. Good-bye.”
Then he went to the real sultan and said: “Good master, Sultan Daaraaee has ordered me to return to our town and put his house in order; he commands me to be here again in a week; if I do not return by that time, he will stay here until I come.”
The sultan asked him if he would not like to have some soldiers go with him; but the gazelle replied that he was quite competent to take care of himself, as his previous journeys had proved, and he preferred to go alone; so with mutual good wishes they parted.
But Keejeepaa did not go in the direction of the old village. He struck off by another road through the forest, and after a time came to a very fine town, of large, handsome houses. As he went through the principal street, right to the far end, he was greatly astonished to observe that the town seemed to have no inhabitants, for he saw neither man, woman, nor child in all the place.
At the end of the main street he came upon the largest and most beautiful house he had ever seen, built of sapphire, and turquoise, and costly marbles.
“Oh, my!” said the gazelle; “this house would just suit my master. I’ll have to pluck up my courage and see whether this is deserted like the other houses in this mysterious town.”
So Keejeepaa knocked at the door, and called, “Hullo, there!” several times; but no one answered. And he said to himself: “This is strange! If there were no one inside, the door would be fastened on the outside. Perhaps they are in another part of the house, or asleep. I’ll call again, louder.”
So he called again, very loud and long, “Hul-lo, th-e-re! Hul-lo!” And directly an old woman inside answered, “Who is that calling so loudly?”
“It is I, your grandchild, good mistress,” said Keejeepaa.
“If you are my grandchild,” replied the old woman, “go back to your home at once; don’t come and die here, and bring me to my death also.”
“Oh, come,” said he, “open the door, mistress; I have just a few words I wish to say to you.”
“My dear grandson,” she replied, “the only reason why I do not open the door is because I fear to endanger both your life and my own.”
“Oh, don’t worry about that; I guess your life and mine are safe enough for a while. Open the door, anyhow, and hear the little I have to say.”
So the old woman opened the door.
Then they exchanged salutations and compliments, after which she asked the gazelle, “What’s the news from your place, grandson?”
“Oh, everything is going along pretty well,” said he; “what’s the news around here?”
“Ah!” sighed the old creature; “the news here is very bad. If you’re looking for a place to die in, you’ve struck it here. I’ve not the slightest doubt you’ll see all you want of death this very day.”
“Huh!” replied Keejeepaa, lightly; “for a fly to die in honey is not bad for the fly, and doesn’t injure the honey.”
“It may be all very well for you to be easy about it,” persisted the old person; “but if people with swords and shields did not escape, how can a little thing like you avoid danger? I must again beg of you to go back to the place you came from. Your safety seems of more interest to me than it is to you.”
“Well, you see, I can’t go back just now; and besides, I want to find out more about this place. Who owns it?”
“Ah, grandson, in this house are enormous wealth, numbers of people, hundreds of horses, and the owner is Neeo′ka Mkoo′, the wonderfully big snake. He owns this whole town, also.”
“Oho! Is that so?” said Keejeepaa. “Look here, old lady; can’t you put me on to some plan of getting near this big snake, that I may kill him?”
“Mercy!” cried the old woman, in affright; “don’t talk like that. You’ve put my life in danger already, for I’m sure Neeoka Mkoo can hear what is said in this house, wherever he is. You see I’m a poor old woman, and I have been placed here, with those pots and pans, to cook for him. Well, when the big snake is coming, the wind begins to blow and the dust flies as it would do in a great storm. Then, when he arrives in the courtyard, he eats until he is full, and after that, goes inside there to drink water. When he has finished, he goes away again. This occurs every other day, just when the sun is overhead. I may add that Neeoka Mkoo has seven heads. Now, then, do you think yourself a match for him?”
“Look here, mother,” said the gazelle, “don’t you worry about me. Has this big snake a sword?”
“He has. This is it,” said she, taking from its peg a very keen and beautiful blade, and handing it to him; “but what’s the use in bothering about it? We are dead already.”
“We shall see about that,” said Keejeepaa.
Just at that moment the wind began to blow, and the dust to fly, as if a great storm were approaching.
“Do you hear the great one coming?” cried the old woman.
“Pshaw!” said the gazelle; “I’m a great one also—and I have the advantage of being on the inside. Two bulls can’t live in one cattle-pen. Either he will live in this house, or I will.”
Notwithstanding the terror the old lady was in, she had to smile at the assurance of this little undersized gazelle, and repeated over again her account of the people with swords and shields who had been killed by the big snake.
“Ah, stop your gabbling!” said the gazelle; “you can’t always judge a banana by its color or size. Wait and see, grandma.”
In a very little while the big snake, Neeoka Mkoo, came into the courtyard, and went around to all the pots and ate their contents. Then he came to the door.
“Hullo, old lady,” said he; “how is it I smell a new kind of odor inside there?”
“Oh, that’s nothing, good master,” replied the old woman; “I’ve been so busy around here lately I haven’t had time to look after myself; but this morning I used some perfume, and that’s what you smell.”
Now, Keejeepaa had drawn the sword, and was standing just inside the doorway; so, when the big snake put his head in, it was cut off so quickly that its owner did not know it was gone. When he put in his second head it was cut off with the same quickness; and, feeling a little irritation, he exclaimed, “Who’s inside there, scratching me?” He then thrust in his third head, and that was cut off also.
This continued until six heads had been disposed of, when Neeoka Mkoo unfolded his rings and lashed around so that the gazelle and the old woman could not see one another through the dust.
Then the snake thrust in his seventh head, and the gazelle, crying: “Now your time has come; you’ve climbed many trees, but this you can not climb,” severed it, and immediately fell down in a fainting fit.
Well, that old woman, although she was seventy-five years of age, jumped, and shouted, and laughed, like a girl of nine. Then she ran and got water, and sprinkled the gazelle, and turned him this way and that way, until at last he sneezed; which greatly pleased the old person, who fanned him and tended him until he was quite recovered.
“Oh, my!” said she; “who would have thought you could be a match for him, my grandson?”
“Well, well,” said Keejeepaa; “that’s all over. Now show me everything around this place.”
So she showed him everything, from top to bottom: store-rooms full of goods, chambers full of expensive foods, rooms containing handsome people who had been kept prisoners for a long time, slaves, and everything.
Next he asked her if there was any person who was likely to lay claim to the place or make any trouble; and she answered: “No one; everything here belongs to you.”
“Very well, then,” said he, “you stay here and take care of these things until I bring my master. This place belongs to him now.”
Keejeepaa stayed three days examining the house, and said to himself: “Well, when my master comes here he will be much pleased with what I have done for him, and he’ll appreciate it after the life he’s been accustomed to. As to his father-in-law, there is not a house in his town that can compare with this.”
On the fourth day he departed, and in due time arrived at the town where the sultan and his master lived. Then there were great rejoicings; the sultan being particularly pleased at his return, while his master felt as if he had received a new lease of life.
After everything had settled down a little, Keejeepaa told his master he must be ready to go, with his wife, to his new home after four days. Then he went and told the sultan that Sultan Daaraaee desired to take his wife to his own town in four days; to which the sultan strongly objected; but the gazelle said it was his master’s wish, and at last everything was arranged.
On the day of the departure a great company assembled to escort Sultan Daaraaee and his bride. There were the bride’s ladies-in-waiting, and slaves, and horsemen, and Keejeepaa leading them all.
So they traveled three days, resting when the sun was overhead, and stopping each evening about five o’clock to eat and sleep; arising next morning at day-break, eating, and going forward again. And all this time the gazelle took very little rest, going all through the company, from the ladies to the slaves, and seeing that every one was well supplied with food and quite comfortable; therefore the entire company loved him and valued him like the apples of their eyes.
On the fourth day, during the afternoon, many houses came into view, and some of the folks called Keejeepaa’s attention to them. “Certainly,” said he; “that is our town, and that house you see yonder is the palace of Sultan Daaraaee.”
So they went on, and all the company filed into the courtyard, while the gazelle and his master went into the house.
When the old woman saw Keejeepaa, she began to dance, and shout, and carry on, just as she did when he killed Neeoka Mkoo, and taking up his foot she kissed it; but Keejeepaa said: “Old lady, let me alone; the one to be made much of is this my master, Sultan Daaraaee. Kiss his feet; he has the first honors whenever he is present.”
The old woman excused herself for not knowing the master, and then Sultan Daaraaee and the gazelle went around on a tour of inspection. The sultan ordered all the prisoners to be released, the horses to be sent out to pasture, all the rooms to be swept, the furniture to be dusted, and, in the meantime, servants were busy preparing food. Then every one had apartments assigned to him, and all were satisfied.
After they had remained there some time, the ladies who had accompanied the bride expressed a desire to return to their own homes. Keejeepaa begged them not to hurry away, but after a while they departed, each loaded with gifts by the gazelle, for whom they had a thousand times more affection than for his master. Then things settled down to their regular routine.
One day the gazelle said to the old woman: “I think the conduct of my master is very singular. I have done nothing but good for him all the time I have been with him. I came to this town and braved many dangers for him, and when all was over I gave everything to him. Yet he has never asked: ‘How did you get this house? How did you get this town? Who is the owner of this house? Have you rented all these things, or have they been given you? What has become of the inhabitants of the place?’ I don’t understand him. And further: although I have done nothing but good for him, he has never done one good thing for me. Nothing here is really his. He never saw such a house or town as this since the day he was born, and he doesn’t own anything of it. I believe the old folks were right when they said, ‘If you want to do any person good, don’t do too much; do him a little harm occasionally, and he’ll think more of you.’ However, I’ve done all I can now, and I’d like to see him make some little return.”
Next morning the old woman was awakened early by the gazelle calling, “Mother! Mother!” When she went to him she found he was sick in his stomach, feverish, and all his legs ached.
“Go,” said he, “and tell my master I am very ill.”
So she went upstairs and found the master and mistress sitting on a marble couch, covered with a striped silk scarf from India.
“Well,” said the master, “what do you want, old woman?”
“Oh, my master,” cried she, “Keejeepaa is sick!”
The mistress started and said: “Dear me! What is the matter with him?”
“All his body pains him. He is sick all over.”
“Oh, well,” said the master, “what can I do? Go and get some of that red millet, that is too common for our use, and make him some gruel.”
“Gracious!” exclaimed his wife, staring at him in amazement; “do you wish her to feed our friend with stuff that a horse would not eat if he were ever so hungry? This is not right of you.”
“Ah, get out!” said he, “you’re crazy. We eat rice; isn’t red millet good enough for a gazelle that cost only a dime?”
“Oh, but he is no ordinary gazelle. He should be as dear to you as the apple of your eye. If sand got in your eye it would trouble you.”
“You talk too much,” returned her husband; then, turning to the old woman, he said, “Go and do as I told you.”
So the old woman went downstairs, and when she saw the gazelle, she began to cry, and say, “Oh, dear! oh, dear!”
It was a long while before the gazelle could persuade her to tell him what had passed upstairs, but at last she told him all. When he had heard it, he said: “Did he really tell you to make me red millet gruel?”
“Ah,” cried she, “do you think I would say such a thing if it were not so?”
“Well,” said Keejeepaa, “I believe what the old folks said was right. However, we’ll give him another chance. Go up to him again, and tell him I am very sick, and that I can’t eat that gruel.”
So she went upstairs, and found the master and mistress sitting by the window, drinking coffee.
The master, looking around and seeing her, said: “What’s the matter now, old woman?”
And she said: “Master, I am sent by Keejeepaa. He is very sick indeed, and has not taken the gruel you told me to make for him.”
“Oh, bother!” he exclaimed. “Hold your tongue, and keep your feet still, and shut your eyes, and stop your ears with wax; then, if that gazelle tells you to come up here, say that your legs are stiff; and if he tells you to listen, say your ears are deaf; and if he tells you to look, say your sight has failed you; and if he wants you to talk, tell him your tongue is paralyzed.”
When the old woman heard these words, she stood and stared, and was unable to move. As for his wife, her face became sad, and the tears began to start from her eyes; observing which, her husband said, sharply, “What’s the matter with you, sultan’s daughter?”
The lady replied, “A man’s madness is his undoing.”
“Why do you say that, mistress?” he inquired.
“Ah,” said she, “I am grieved, my husband, at your treatment of Keejeepaa. Whenever I say a good word for the gazelle you dislike to hear it. I pity you that your understanding is gone.”
“What do you mean by talking in that manner to me?” he blustered.
“Why, advice is a blessing, if properly taken. A husband should advise with his wife, and a wife with her husband; then they are both blessed.”
“Oh, stop,” said her husband, impatiently; “it’s evident you’ve lost your senses. You should be chained up.” Then he said to the old woman: “Never mind her talk; and as to this gazelle, tell him to stop bothering me and putting on style, as if he were the sultan. I can’t eat, I can’t drink, I can’t sleep, because of that gazelle worrying me with his messages. First, the gazelle is sick; then, the gazelle doesn’t like what he gets to eat. Confound it! If he likes to eat, let him eat; if he doesn’t like to eat, let him die and be out of the way. My mother is dead, and my father is dead, and I still live and eat; shall I be put out of my way by a gazelle, that I bought for a dime, telling me he wants this thing or that thing? Go and tell him to learn how to behave himself toward his superiors.”
When the old woman went downstairs, she found the gazelle was bleeding at the mouth, and in a very bad way. All she could say was, “My son, the good you did is all lost; but be patient.”
And the gazelle wept with the old woman when she told him all that had passed, and he said, “Mother, I am dying, not only from sickness, but from shame and anger at this man’s ingratitude.”
After a while Keejeepaa told the old woman to go and tell the master that he believed he was dying. When she went upstairs she found Daaraaee chewing sugar-cane, and she said to him, “Master, the gazelle is worse; we think him nearer to dying than getting well.”
To which he answered: “Haven’t I told you often enough not to bother me?”
Then his wife said: “Oh, husband, won’t you go down and see the poor gazelle? If you don’t like to go, let me go and see him. He never gets a single good thing from you.”
But he turned to the old woman and said, “Go and tell that nuisance of a gazelle to die eleven times if he chooses to.”
“Now, husband,” persisted the lady, “what has Keejeepaa done to you? Has he done you any wrong? Such words as yours people use to their enemies only. Surely the gazelle is not your enemy. All the people who know him, great and lowly, love him dearly, and they will think it very wrong of you if you neglect him. Now, do be kind to him, Sultan Daaraaee.”
But he only repeated his assertion that she had lost her wits, and would have nothing further of argument.
So the old woman went down and found the gazelle worse than ever.
In the meantime Sultan Daaraaee’s wife managed to give some rice to a servant to cook for the gazelle, and also sent him a soft shawl to cover him and a pillow to lie upon. She also sent him a message that if he wished, she would have her father’s best physicians attend him.
All this was too late, however, for just as these good things arrived, Keejeepaa died.
When the people heard he was dead, they went running around crying and having an awful time; and when Sultan Daaraaee found out what all the commotion was about he was very indignant, remarking, “Why, you are making as much fuss as if I were dead, and all over a gazelle that I bought for a dime!”
But his wife said: “Husband, it was this gazelle that came to ask me of my father, it was he who brought me from my father’s, and it was to him I was given by my father. He gave you everything good, and you do not possess a thing that he did not procure for you. He did everything he could to help you, and you not only returned him unkindness, but now he is dead you have ordered people to throw him into the well. Let us alone, that we may weep.”
But the gazelle was taken and thrown into the well.
Then the lady wrote a letter telling her father to come to her directly, and despatched it by trusty messengers; upon the receipt of which the sultan and his attendants started hurriedly to visit his daughter.
When they arrived, and heard that the gazelle was dead and had been thrown into the well, they wept very much; and the sultan, and the vizir, and the judges, and the rich chief men, all went down into the well and brought up the body of Keejeepaa, and took it away with them and buried it.
Now, that night the lady dreamt that she was at home at her father’s house; and when dawn came she awoke and found she was in her own bed in her own town again.
And her husband dreamed that he was on the dust heap, scratching; and when he awoke there he was, with both hands full of dust, looking for grains of millet. Staring wildly he looked around to the right and left, saying: “Oh, who has played this trick on me? How did I get back here, I wonder?”
Just then the children going along, and seeing him, laughed and hooted at him, calling out: “Hullo, Haamdaanee, where have you been? Where do you come from? We thought you were dead long ago.”
So the sultan’s daughter lived in happiness with her people until the end, and that beggar-man continued to scratch for grains of millet in the dust heap until he died.
If this story is good, the goodness belongs to all; if it is bad, the badness belongs only to him who told it.

“One day in the early morning, before any people were awake, Jakhals was prowling round and prowling round, looking for something to eat. Jakhals is not fond of hunting for himself. Oh, no! he likes to wait till the hunt is over, so that he can share in the feast without having had any of the work. He had just dragged himself quietly to the top of a kopje—so, my baasjes, so—with his stomach close to the ground, and his ears moving backwards and forwards”—Outa’s little hands, on either side of the kopdoek, suited the action to the word—“to hear the least sound. Then he looked here, he looked there, he looked all around, and yes, truly! whom do you think he saw in the kloof below? No other than Oom Leeuw himself, clawing a nice big hamel he had just killed—a Boer hamel, baasjes, with a beautiful fat tail. Oh yes, Oom Leeuw had picked out a good one.
“‘Arré!’ thought Jakhals, ‘this is luck,’ and he sat still for a minute, wondering how he could get some of the nice meat for himself. He soon made a plan. A white thing fluttered in a little bush near him. It was a piece of paper. He picked it up and folded it—so—and so—and so—” the crooked fingers were very busy—“till it looked like a letter. Then he ran down the kopje in a great hurry and called out, ‘Good morning, Oom.’
“‘Morning, Neef.’
“‘I see Oom has killed a Boer hamel.’
“‘Yes, Neef, a big fat one.’
“‘Well, here is a letter from Tante,’ said Jakhals, giving the piece of paper to Leeuw. ‘As I was passing she asked me to give it to Oom.’
“Leeuw took it and turned it this way, that way. He held it far from him, he held it close to his eyes, but he couldn’t make it out at all. See, baasjes, Leeuw was one of the old-fashioned sort. He grew up before there were so many schools and good teachers”—here Outa’s bright eyes winked and blinked flatteringly on Cousin Minnie and her pupils—“he was not clever; he could not read. But he didn’t want anyone to know it, so he said:
“‘Jakhals, Oom has forgotten his spectacles; you had better read it out.”
“‘Hm, hm, hm,’ said Jakhals, pretending to read. ‘Tante says Oom must kill a nice fat Boer hamel and send it home at once by me. She and the children are hungry.’
“‘Well, that’s all right. Here is the very thing. Tante is not very well. The Jew smouse’s donkey she ate the other day disagreed with her, so we must coax her a little. I don’t want tosayanything, but you know avrouwmensis a dangerous thing when she is in a temper. So you had better take this hamel to her at once, and then you can have the offal for your trouble.”
“‘Thank you, noble Oom, King of Beasts,’ said Jakhals in a fawning voice, promising himself at the same time that he would have something more than the offal. ‘How fortunate am I, poor humble creature, to have the King for my uncle,’ and off he trotted with the sheep.
“Leeuw prowled further up the kloof, waving his tail from side to side.” Had Outa had a tail he would have wagged it, but, as he had not, his right arm was slowly flourished to and fro to give point to his description. “Here comes a little Steenbokje on its way to a veld dam for water. Ach! but it is pretty! It looks here, it looks there, with its large soft eyes. One little front foot is in the air; now it is down; the other goes up; down again. On it comes, slowly, slowly”—Outa’s hands, bunched up to resemble the buck’s feet, illustrated each step, the children following his movements with breathless interest. “Now it stops to listen.” Outa was rigid as he bent forward to catch the least sound. Suddenly he started violently, and the children involuntarily did the same. “Hark! what was that? What is coming? Ach! how Steenbokje skriks and shivers! A terrible form blocks the way! Great eyes—cruel eyes burn him with their fire. Now he knows. It is Leeuw!—Leeuw who stands in the path! He growls and glares at Steenbokje. Steenbokje cannot turn away. They stare at each other—so—just so—” Outa glares at each fascinated child in turn. “Steenbokje cannot look away, cannot move. He is stiff with fright. His blood is cold. His eyes are starting out of his head. And then—voops!”—the listeners jump as Outa’s long arms suddenly swoop towards them—“one spring and Leeuw is on him. Steenbokje blares—meh, meh, meh—but it is no good. Leeuw tears him and claws him. Tip, tip, tip, the red blood drips down; s-s-s-s-s, it runs out like a stream, and Leeuw licks it up. There lies pretty little Steenbokje, dead, dead.” Outa’s voice trails away faintly.
The children heave big sighs. Little Jan’s grey eyes are full of tears. The old native’s graphic description has made them feel as though they had been watching round a death-bed.
“Yes, baasjes, Leeuw killed Steenbokje there in the kloof. He tore the skin off—skr-r-r-r—and bit through the bones—skrnch, skrnch, skrnch—and ate little Steenbokje for his breakfast. Then he went to the krantzes to sleep, for the day was coming and the light began to hurt his eyes.
“When he awoke it was evening, and he felt refreshed and rather hungry. My baasjes know a steenbokje is nothing for a meal for Oom Leeuw. But before hunting again he thought he would go home and see how Tante and the children were getting on, and whether they had feasted well on the nice fat hamel.
“But, dear land! What did poor Oom Leeuw find? The children crying, Tante spluttering and scratching with rage, everything upside down, and not even the bones of the hamel to be seen.
“‘Ohé! ohé! ohé!’ cried Tante. ‘The bad, wicked Jakhals! Ach, the low, veld dog!’
“‘But what is the matter?’ asked Leeuw. ‘Where is Jakhals?’
“‘Where is he? How should I know? He has run off with the nice fat hamel, and me—yes,me, the King’s wife—has he beaten with the entrails! Ohé! ohé!’
“‘And boxed my ears!’ cried one of the cubs. ‘Wah! wah! wah!’
“‘And pinched my tail,’ roared the other. ‘Weh! weh! weh!’
“‘And left us nothing but the offal. Oh, the cunning, smooth-tongued vagabond!’
“And all three fell to weeping and wailing, while Leeuw roared aloud in his anger.
“‘Wait a bit, I’ll get him,’ he said. ‘Before the world wakes to-morrow he’ll see who’s baas.’
“He waved his tail to and fro and stuck out his strong claws. His eyes glared like fire in a dark kloof when there is no moon, and when he brulled it was very terrible to hear—hoor-r-r-r-r, hoor-r-r-r-r,” and Outa gave vent to several deep, blood-curdling roars.
“Very early the next morning, when only a little grey in the sky shewed that the night was rolling round to the other side of the world, Leeuw took his strongest sjambok and started off to look for Jakhals. He spied him at last on the top of a krantz sitting by a fire with his wife and children.
“‘Ah! there you are, my fine fellow,’ he thought. ‘Well and happy are you? But wait, I’ll soon show you!’
“He began at once to try and climb the krantz, but it was very steep and high, and so smooth that there was nothing for him to hold to. Every time he got up a little way, his claws just scratched along the hard rock and he came sailing down again. At last he thought, ‘Well, as I can’t climb up, I’ll pretend to be nice and friendly, and then perhaps Jakhals will come down. I’ll ask him to go hunting with me.’”
Here Outa’s beady little eyes danced mischievously. “Baasjes know, the only way to get the better of a schelm is to be schelm, too. When anyone cheats, you must cheat more, or you will never be baas. Ach, yes! that is the only way.”
(Cousin Minnie would not disturb the course of the tale, but she mentally prescribed and stored up for future use an antidote to this pagan and wordly-wise piece of advice to her pupils.)
“So Leeuw stood at the foot of the krantz and called out quite friendly and kind, ‘Good morning, Neef Jakhals.’
“‘Morning, Oom.’
“‘I thought you might like to go hunting with me, but I see you are busy.’
“At any other time Jakhals would have skipped with delight, for it was very seldom he had the honour of such an invitation, but now he was blown up with conceit at having cheated Oom and Tante Leeuw so nicely.
“‘Thank you, Oom, but I am not in want of meat just now. I’m busy grilling some nice fat mutton chops for breakfast. Won’t you come and have some, too?’
“‘Certainly, with pleasure, but this krantz is so steep—how can I get up?’
“‘Ach! that’s quite easy, Oom. I’ll pull you up in an eye-wink. Here, vrouw, give me a nice thick riem. That old rotten one that is nearly rubbed through,’ he said in a whisper to his wife.
“So Mrs. Jakhals, who was asslimas her husband, brought the bad riem, and they set to work to pull Oom Leeuw up. ‘Hoo-ha! hoo-ha!’ they sang as they slowly hauled away.
“When he was about ten feet from the ground, Jakhals called out, ‘Arré! but Oom is heavy,’ and he pulled the riem this way and that way along the sharp edge of the krantz”—Outa vigorously demonstrated—“till it broke right through and—kabloops!—down fell Oom Leeuw to the hard ground below.
“‘Oh! my goodness! What a terrible fall! I hope Oom is not hurt. How stupid can a vrouwmens be! To give me an old riem when I called for the best! Now, here is a strong one. Oom can try again.’
“So Leeuw tried again, and again, and again, many times over, but each time the rope broke and each time his fall was greater, because Jakhals always pulled him up a little higher, and a little higher. At last he called out:
“‘It’s very kind of you, Jakhals, but I must give it up.’
“‘Ach! but that’s a shame!’ said Jakhals, pretending to be sorry. ‘The carbonaatjes are done to a turn, and the smell—alle wereld!it’s fine! Shall I throw Oom down a piece of the meat?’
“‘Yes please, Jakhals,’ said Leeuw eagerly, licking his lips. ‘I have a big hole inside me and some carbonaatjes will fill it nicely.’
“Ach! my baasjes, what did cunning Jakhals do? He carefully raked a red-hot stone out of the fire and wrapped a big piece of fat round it. Then he peered over the edge of the krantz and saw Leeuw waiting impatiently.
“‘Now Oom,’ he called, ‘open your mouth wide and I’ll drop this in. It’s such a nice big one, I bet you won’t want another.’
“And when he said this, Jakhals chuckled, while Mrs. Jakhals and the little ones doubled up with silent laughter at the great joke.
“‘Are you ready, Oom?’
“‘Grr-r-r-r-r!’ gurgled Leeuw. He had his mouth wide open to catch the carbonaatje, and he would not speak for fear of missing it.
“Jakhals leaned over and took aim. Down fell the tit-bit and—sluk! sluk!—Leeuw had swallowed it.
“And then, my baasjes, there arose such a roaring and raving and groaning as had not been heard since the hills were made. The dassies crept along the rocky ledges far above, and peeped timidly down; the circling eagles swooped nearer to find out the cause; the meerkats and ant-bears, the porcupines and spring-hares snuggled further into their holes; while the frightened springboks and elands fled swiftly over the plain to seek safety in some other veld.
“Only wicked Jakhals and his family rejoiced. With their bushy tails waving and their pointed ears standing up, they danced round the fire, holding hands and singing over and over:
“‘Arré! who is stronger than the King of Beastland?
Arré! who sees further than the King of Birdland?
Who but thick-tailed Jakhals, but the Silver-maned One?
He, the small but sly one; he, the wise Planmaker.
King of Beasts would catch him; catch him, claw him, kill him!
Ha! ha! ha! would catch him! Ha! ha! ha! would kill him!
But he finds a way out; grills the fat-tailed hamel,
Feeds the King of Beastland with the juicy tit-bits;
Eats the fat-tailed hamel while the King lies dying;
Ha! ha! ha! lies dying! Ha! ha! ha! lies dead now!’”
Outa crooned the Jakhals’ triumph song in a weird monotone, and on the last words his voice quavered out, leaving a momentary silence among the small folk.
Pietie blinked as though the firelight were too much for his eyes. Little Jan sighed tumultuously. Willem cleared his throat.
“But how did Jakhalsknowthat Oom Leeuw was dead?” he asked suddenly.
“He peeped over the krantz every time between the dancing and singing—like this, baasje, just like this.” Outa’s eyes, head and hands were at work. “The first time he looked, he saw Oom Leeuw rolling over and over; the next time Leeuw was scratching, scratching at the rocky krantz; then he was digging into the ground with his claws; then he was only blowing himself out—so—with long slow breaths; but the last time he was lying quite still, and then Jakhalsknew.”
“Oh! Ididn’twant poor Steenbokje to die,” said little Jan. “He was such a pretty little thing. Outa, this is not one of your nicest stories.”
“It’s all about killing,” said Pietie. “First Leeuw killed poor Steenbokje, who never did him any harm, and then Jakhals killed Oom Leeuw, who never didhimany harm. It was very cruel and wicked.”
“Ach yes, baasjes,” explained Outa, apologetically, “we don’t know why, but it is so. Sometimes the good ones are killed and the bad ones grow fat. In this old world it goes not always so’s it must go; it just go so’s it goes.”
“But,” persisted Pietie, “you oughtn’t to have let Jakhals kill Oom Leeuw. Oom Leeuw was much stronger, so he ought to have killed naughty Jakhals.”
Outa’s eyes gleamed pityingly. These young things! What did they know of the ups and downs of a hard world where the battle is not always to the strong, nor the race to the swift?
“But, my baasje, Outa did not make up the story. He only put in little bits, like the newspaper and the spectacles and the Jew smouse, that are things of to-day. But the real story was made long, long ago, perhaps when baasje’s people went about in skins like the Rooi Kafirs, and Outa’s people were still monkeys in the bushveld. It has always been so, and it will always be so—in the story and in the old wicked world. It is the head, my baasjes, the head,” he tapped his own, “and not the strong arms and legs and teeth, that makes one animal master over another. Ach yes! if the Bushman’s head had been the same as the white man’s, arré! what a fight there would have been between them!”
And lost in the astonishing train of thought called up by this idea, he sat gazing out before him with eyes which saw many strange things. Then, rousing himself, with a quick change of voice and manner, “Ach! please, Nooi!” he said in a wheedling tone, “a span of tobacco—just one little span for to-night and to-morrow.”
His mistress laughed indulgently, and, unhooking the bunch of keys from her belt, handed them to Cousin Minnie. “The old sinner!” she said. “We all spoil him, and yet who could begin to be strict with him now? Only a small piece, Minnie.”
“Thank you, thank you, my Nonnie,” said the old man, holding out both hands, and receiving the coveted span as if it were something very precious. “That’smyyoung lady! Nonnie can have Outa’s skeleton when he is dead. Yes, it will be a fine skeleton for Nonnie to send far across the blue water, where she sent the old long-dead Bushman’s bones. Ach foei! all of him went into a little soap boxie—just to think of it! a soap boxie!”
He started as a young coloured girl made her appearance. “O mij lieve!here is Lys already. How the time goes when a person is with the baasjes and the noois! Night, Baas; night, Nooi; night, Nonnie and little masters. Sleep well! Ach! the beautiful family Van der Merwe!”
His thanks, farewells and flatteries grew fainter and fainter, and finally died away in the distance, as his granddaughter led him away.

Once upon a time there lived in Japan a rat and his wife who came of an old and noble race, and had one daughter, the loveliest girl in all the rat world. Her parents were very proud of her, and spared no pains to teach her all she ought to know. There was not another young lady in the whole town who was as clever as she was in gnawing through the hardest wood, or who could drop from such a height on to a bed, or run away so fast if anyone was heard coming. Great attention, too, was paid to her personal appearance, and her skin shone like satin, while her teeth were as white as pearls, and beautifully pointed.
Of course, with all these advantages, her parents expected her to make a brilliant marriage, and, as she grew up, they began to look round for a suitable husband.
But here a difficulty arose. The father was a rat from the tip of his nose to the end of his tail, outside as well as in, and desired that his daughter should wed among her own people. She had no lack of lovers, but her father’s secret hopes rested on a fine young rat, with moustaches which almost swept the ground, whose family was still nobler and more ancient than his own. Unluckily, the mother had other views for her precious child. She was one of those people who always despise their own family and surroundings, and take pleasure in thinking that they themselves are made of finer material than the rest of the world. ‘HER daughter should never marry a mere rat,’ she declared, holding her head high. ‘With her beauty and talents she had a right to look for someone a little better than THAT.’
So she talked, as mothers will, to anyone that would listen to her. What the girl thought about the matter nobody knew or cared–it was not the fashion in the rat world.
Many were the quarrels which the old rat and his wife had upon the subject, and sometimes they bore on their faces certain marks which looked as if they had not kept to words only.
‘Reach up to the stars is MY motto,’ cried the lady one day, when she was in a greater passion than usual. ‘My daughter’s beauty places her higher than anything upon earth,’ she cried; ‘and I am certainly not going to accept a son-in-law who is beneath her.’
‘Better offer her in marriage to the sun,’ answered her husband impatiently. ‘As far as I know there is nothing greater than he.’
‘Well, I WAS thinking of it,’ replied the wife, ‘and as you are of the same mind, we will pay him a visit to-morrow.’
So the next morning, the two rats, having spent hours in making themselves smart, set out to see the sun, leading their daughter between them.
The journey took some time, but at length they came to the golden palace where the sun lived.
‘Noble king,’ began the mother, ‘behold our daughter! She is so beautiful that she is above everything in the whole world. Naturally, we wish for a son-in-law who, on his side, is greater than all. Therefore we have come to you.’
‘I feel very much flattered,’ replied the sun, who was so busy that he had not the least wish to marry anybody. ‘You do me great honour by your proposal. Only, in one point you are mistaken, and it would be wrong of me to take advantage of your ignorance. There is something greater than I am, and that is the cloud. Look!’ And as he spoke a cloud spread itself over the sun’s face, blotting out his rays.
‘Oh, well, we will speak to the cloud,’ said the mother. And turning to the cloud she repeated her proposal.
‘Indeed I am unworthy of anything so charming,’ answered the cloud; ‘but you make a mistake again in what you say. There is one thing that is even more powerful than I, and that is the wind. Ah, here he comes, you can see for yourself.’
And she DID see, for catching up the cloud as he passed, he threw it on the other side of the sky. Then, tumbling father, mother and daughter down to the earth again, he paused for a moment beside them, his foot on an old wall.
When she had recovered her breath, the mother began her little speech once more.
‘The wall is the proper husband for your daughter,’ answered the wind, whose home consisted of a cave, which he only visited when he was not rushing about elsewhere; ‘you can see for yourself that he is greater than I, for he has power to stop me in my flight.’ And the mother, who did not trouble to conceal her wishes, turned at once to the wall.
Then something happened which was quite unexpected by everyone.
‘I won’t marry that ugly old wall, which is as old as my grandfather,’ sobbed the girl, who had not uttered one word all this time. ‘I would have married the sun, or the cloud, or the wind, because it was my duty, although I love the handsome young rat, and him only. But that horrid old wall–I would sooner die!’
And the wall, rather hurt in his feelings, declared that he had no claim to be the husband of so beautiful a girl.
‘It is quite true,’ he said, ‘that I can stop the wind who can part the clouds who can cover the sun; but there is someone who can do more than all these, and that is the rat. It is the rat who passes through me, and can reduce me to powder, simply with his teeth. If, therefore, you want a son-in-law who is greater than the whole world, seek him among the rats.’
‘Ah, what did I tell you?’ cried the father. And his wife, though for the moment angry at being beaten, soon thought that a rat son-in-law was what she had always desired.
So all three returned happily home, and the wedding was celebrated three days after.

A long time ago a little town made up of a collection of low huts stood in a tiny green valley at the foot of a cliff. Of course the people had taken great care to build their houses out of reach of the highest tide which might be driven on shore by a west wind, but on the very edge of the town there had sprung up a tree so large that half its boughs hung over the huts and the other half over the deep sea right under the cliff, where sharks loved to come and splash in the clear water. The branches of the tree itself were laden with fruit, and every day at sunrise a big grey monkey might have been seen sitting in the topmost branches having his breakfast, and chattering to himself with delight.
After he had eaten all the fruit on the town side of the tree the monkey swung himself along the branches to the part which hung over the water. While he was looking out for a nice shady place where he might perch comfortably he noticed a shark watching him from below with greedy eyes.
‘Can I do anything for you, my friend?’ asked the monkey politely.
‘Oh! if you only would thrown me down some of those delicious things, I should be so grateful,’ answered the shark. ‘After you have lived on fish for fifty years you begin to feel you would like a change. And I am so very, very tired of the taste of salt.’
‘Well, I don’t like salt myself,’ said the monkey; ‘so if you will open your mouth I will throw this beautiful juicy kuyu into it,’ and, as he spoke, he pulled one off the branch just over his head. But it was not so easy to hit the shark’s mouth as he supposed, even when the creature had turned on his back, and the first kuyu only struck one of his teeth and rolled into the water. However, the second time the monkey had better luck, and the fruit fell right in.
‘Ah, how good!’ cried the shark. ‘Send me another, please.’ And the monkey grew tired of picking the kuyu long before the shark was tired of eating them.
‘It is getting late, and I must be going home to my children,’ he said, at length, ‘but if you are here at the same time to-morrow I will give you another treat.’
‘Thank you, thank you,’ said the shark, showing all his great ugly teeth as he grinned with delight; ‘you can’t guess how happy you have made me,’ and he swam away into the shadow, hoping to sleep away the time till the monkey came again.
For weeks the monkey and the shark breakfasted together, and it was a wonder that the tree had any fruit left for them. They became fast friends, and told each other about their homes and their children, and how to teach them all they ought to know. By and bye the monkey became rather discontented with his green house in a grove of palms beyond the town, and longed to see the strange things under the sea which he had heard of from the shark. The shark perceived this very clearly, and described greater marvels, and the monkey as he listened grew more and more gloomy.
Matters were in this state when one day the shark said: ‘I really hardly know how to thank you for all your kindness to me during these weeks. Here I have nothing of my own to offer you, but if you would only consent to come home with me, how gladly would I give you anything that might happen to take your fancy.’
‘I should like nothing better,’ cried the monkey, his teeth chattering, as they always did when he was pleased. ‘But how could I get there? Not by water. Ugh! It makes me ill to think of it!’
‘Oh! don’t let that trouble you,’ replied the shark, ‘you have only to sit on my back and I will undertake that not a drop of water shall touch you.’
So it was arranged, and directly after breakfast next morning the shark swam close up under the tree and the monkey dropped neatly on his back, without even a splash. After a few minutes–for at first he felt a little frightened at his strange position–the monkey began to enjoy himself vastly, and asked the shark a thousand questions about the fish and the sea-weeds and the oddly-shaped things that floated past them, and as the shark always gave him some sort of answer, the monkey never guessed that many of the objects they saw were as new to his guide as to himself.
The sun had risen and set six times when the shark suddenly said, ‘My friend, we have now performed half our journey, and it is time that I should tell you something.’
‘What is it?’ asked the monkey. ‘Nothing unpleasant, I hope, for you sound rather grave?’
‘Oh, no! Nothing at all. It is only that shortly before we left I heard that the sultan of my country is very ill, and that the only thing to cure him is a monkey’s heart.’
‘Poor man, I am very sorry for him,’ replied the monkey; ‘but you were unwise not to tell me till we had started.’
‘What do you mean?’ asked the shark; but the monkey, who now understood the whole plot, did not answer at once, for he was considering what he should say.
‘Why are you so silent?’ inquired the shark again.
‘I was thinking what a pity it was you did not tell me while I was still on land, and then I would have brought my heart with me.’
‘Your heart! Why isn’t your heart here?’ said the shark, with a puzzled expression.
‘Oh, no! Of course not. Is it possible you don’t know that when we leave home we always hang up our hearts on trees, to prevent their being troublesome? However, perhaps you won’t believe that, and will just think I have invented it because I am afraid, so let us go on to your country as fast as we can, and when we arrive you can look for my heart, and if you find it you can kill me.’
The monkey spoke in such a calm, indifferent way that the shark was quite deceived, and began to wish he had not been in such a hurry.
‘But there is no use going on if your heart is not with you,’ he said at last. ‘We had better turn back to the town, and then you can fetch it.’
Of course, this was just what the monkey wanted, but he was careful not to seem too pleased.
‘Well, I don’t know,’ he remarked carelessly, ‘it is such a long way; but you may be right.’
‘I am sure I am,’ answered the shark, ‘and I will swim as quickly as I can,’ and so he did, and in three days they caught sight of the kuyu tree hanging over the water.
With a sigh of relief the monkey caught hold of the nearest branch and swung himself up.
‘Wait for me here,’ he called out to the shark. ‘I am so hungry I must have a little breakfast, and then I will go and look for my heart,’ and he went further and further into the branches so that the shark could not see him. Then he curled himself up and went to sleep.
‘Are you there?’ cried the shark, who was soon tired of swimming about under the cliff, and was in haste to be gone.
The monkey awoke with a start, but did not answer.
‘Are you there?’ called the shark again, louder than before, and in a very cross voice.
‘Oh, yes. I am here,’ replied the monkey; ‘but I wish you had not wakened me up. I was having such a nice nap.’
‘Have you got it?’ asked the shark. ‘It is time we were going.’
‘Going where?’ inquired the monkey.
‘Why, to my country, of course, with your heart. You CAN’T have forgotten!’
‘My dear friend,’ answered the monkey, with a chuckle, ‘I think you must be going a little mad. Do you take me for a washerman’s donkey?’
‘Don’t talk nonsense,’ exclaimed the shark, who did not like being laughed at. ‘What do you mean about a washerman’s donkey? And I wish you would be quick, or we may be too late to save the sultan.’
‘Did you really never hear of the washerman’s donkey?’ asked the monkey, who was enjoying himself immensely. ‘Why, he is the beast who has no heart. And as I am not feeling very well, and am afraid to start while the sun is so high lest I should get a sunstroke, if you like, I will come a little nearer and tell you his story.’
‘Very well,’ said the shark sulkily, ‘if you won’t come, I suppose I may as well listen to that as do nothing.’
So the monkey began.
‘A washerman once lived in the great forest on the other side of the town, and he had a donkey to keep him company and to carry him wherever he wanted to go. For a time they got on very well, but by and bye the donkey grew lazy and ungrateful for her master’s kindness, and ran away several miles into the heart of the forest, where she did nothing but eat and eat and eat, till she grew so fat she could hardly move.
‘One day as she was tasting quite a new kind of grass and wondering if it was as good as what she had had for dinner the day before, a hare happened to pass by.
‘”Well, that is a fat creature,” thought she, and turned out of her path to tell the news to a lion who was a friend of hers. Now the lion had been very ill, and was not strong enough to go hunting for himself, and when the hare came and told him that a very fat donkey was to be found only a few hundred yards off, tears of disappointment and weakness filled his eyes.
‘”What is the good of telling me that?” he asked, in a weepy voice; “you know I cannot even walk as far as that palm.”
‘”Never mind,” answered the hare briskly. “If you can’t go to your dinner your dinner shall come to you,” and nodding a farewell to the lion she went back to the donkey.
‘”Good morning,” said she, bowing politely to the donkey, who lifted her head in surprise. “Excuse my interrupting you, but I have come on very important business.”
‘”Indeed,” answered the donkey, “it is most kind of you to take the trouble. May I inquire what the business is?”
‘”Certainly,” replied the hare. “It is my friend the lion who has heard so much of your charms and good qualities that he has sent me to beg that you will give him your paw in marriage. He regrets deeply that he is unable to make the request in person, but he has been ill and is too weak to move.”
‘”Poor fellow! How sad!” said the donkey. “But you must tell him that I feel honoured by his proposal, and will gladly consent to be Queen of the Beasts.”
‘”Will you not come and tell him so yourself?” asked the hare.
‘Side by side they went down the road which led to the lion’s house. It took a long while, for the donkey was so fat with eating she could only walk very slowly, and the hare, who could have run the distance in about five minutes, was obliged to creep along till she almost dropped with fatigue at not being able to go at her own pace. When at last they arrived the lion was sitting up at the entrance, looking very pale and thin. The donkey suddenly grew shy and hung her head, but the lion put on his best manners and invited both his visitors to come in and make themselves comfortable.
‘Very soon the hare got up and said, “Well, as I have another engagement I will leave you to make acquaintance with your future husband,” and winking at the lion she bounded away.
‘The donkey expected that as soon as they were left alone the lion would begin to speak of their marriage, and where they should live, but as he said nothing she looked up. To her surprise and terror she saw him crouching in the corner, his eyes glaring with a red light, and with a loud roar he sprang towards her. But in that moment the donkey had had time to prepare herself, and jumping on one side dealt the lion such a hard kick that he shrieked with the pain. Again and again he struck at her with his claws, but the donkey could bite too, as well as the lion, who was very weak after his illness, and at last a well- planted kick knocked him right over, and he rolled on the floor, groaning with pain. The donkey did not wait for him to get up, but ran away as fast as she could and was lost in the forest.
‘Now the hare, who knew quite well what would happen, had not gone to do her business, but hid herself in some bushes behind the cave, where she could hear quite clearly the sounds of the battle. When all was quiet again she crept gently out, and stole round the corner.
‘”Well, lion, have you killed her?” asked she, running swiftly up the path.
‘”Killed her, indeed!” answered the lion sulkily, “it is she who has nearly killed me. I never knew a donkey could kick like that, though I took care she should carry away the marks of my claws.”
‘”Dear me! Fancy such a great fat creature being able to fight!” cried the hare. “But don’t vex yourself. Just lie still, and your wounds will soon heal,” and she bade her friend, good bye, and returned to her family.
‘Two or three weeks passed, and only bare places on the donkey’s back showed where the lion’s claws had been, while, on his side, the lion had recovered from his illness and was now as strong as ever. He was beginning to think that it was almost time for him to begin hunting again, when one morning a rustle was heard in the creepers outside, and the hare’s head peeped through.
‘”Ah! there is no need to ask how you are,” she said. “Still you mustn’t overtire yourself, you know. Shall I go and bring you your dinner?”
‘”If you will bring me that donkey I will tear it in two,” cried the lion savagely, and the hare laughed and nodded and went on her errand.
‘This time the donkey was much further than before, and it took longer to find her. At last the hare caught sight of four hoofs in the air, and ran towards them. The donkey was lying on a soft cool bed of moss near a stream, rolling herself backwards and forwards from pleasure.
‘”Good morning,” said the hare politely, and the donkey got slowly on to her legs, and looked to see who her visitor could be.
‘”Oh, it is you, is it?” she exclaimed. “Come and have a chat. What news have you got?”
‘”I mustn’t stay,” answered the hare; “but I promised the lion to beg you to pay him a visit, as he is not well enough to call on you.”
‘”Well, I don’t know,” replied the donkey gloomily, “the last time we went he scratched me very badly, and really I was quite afraid.”
‘”He was only trying to kiss you,” said the hare, “and you bit him, and of course that made him cross.”
‘”If I were sure of that,” hesitated the donkey.
‘”Oh, you may be quite sure,” laughed the hare. “I have a large acquaintance among lions. But let us be quick,” and rather unwillingly the donkey set out.
‘The lion saw them coming and hid himself behind a large tree. As the donkey went past, followed by the hare, he sprang out, and with one blow of his paw stretched the poor foolish creature dead before him.
‘”Take this meat and skin it and roast it,” he said to the hare; “but my appetite is not so good as it was, and the only part I want for myself is the heart. The rest you can either eat yourself or give away to your friends.”
‘”Thank you,” replied the hare, balancing the donkey on her back as well as she was able, and though the legs trailed along the ground she managed to drag it to an open space some distance off, where she made a fire and roasted it. As soon as it was cooked the hare took out the heart and had just finished eating it when the lion, who was tired of waiting, came up.
‘”I am hungry,” said he. “Bring me the creature’s heart; it is just what I want for supper.”
‘”But there is no heart,” answered the hare, looking up at the lion with a puzzled face.
‘”What nonsense!” said the lion. “As if every beast had not got a heart. What do you mean?”
‘”This is a washerman’s donkey,” replied the hare gravely.
‘”Well, and suppose it is?”
‘”Oh, fie!” exclaimed the hare. “You, a lion and a grown-up person, and ask questions like that. If the donkey had had a heart would she be here now? The first time she came she knew you were trying to kill her, and ran away. Yet she came back a second time. Well, if she had had a heart would she have come back a second time? Now would she?”
‘And the lion answered slowly, “No, she would not.”
‘So you think I am a washerman’s donkey?’ said the monkey to the shark, when the story was ended. ‘You are wrong; I am not. And as the sun is getting low in the sky, it is time for you to begin your homeward journey. You will have a nice cool voyage, and I hope you will find the sultan better. Farewell!’ And the monkey disappeared among the green branches, and was gone.

One day Soongoo′ra, the hare, roaming through the forest in search of food, glanced up through the boughs of a very large calabash tree, and saw that a great hole in the upper part of the trunk was inhabited by bees; thereupon he returned to town in search of some one to go with him and help to get the honey.
As he was passing the house of Boo′koo, the big rat, that worthy gentleman invited him in. So he went in, sat down, and remarked: “My father has died, and has left me a hive of honey. I would like you to come and help me to eat it.”
Of course Bookoo jumped at the offer, and he and the hare started off immediately.
When they arrived at the great calabash tree, Soongoora pointed out the bees’ nest and said, “Go on; climb up.” So, taking some straw with them, they climbed up to the nest, lit the straw, smoked out the bees, put out the fire, and set to work eating the honey.
In the midst of the feast, who should appear at the foot of the tree but Sim′ba, the lion? Looking up, and seeing them eating, he asked, “Who are you?”
Then Soongoora whispered to Bookoo, “Hold your tongue; that old fellow is crazy.” But in a very little while Simba roared out angrily: “Who are you, I say? Speak, I tell you!” This made Bookoo so scared that he blurted out, “It’s only us!”
Upon this the hare said to him: “You just wrap me up in this straw, call to the lion to keep out of the way, and then throw me down. Then you’ll see what will happen.”
So Bookoo, the big rat, wrapped Soongoora, the hare, in the straw, and then called to Simba, the lion, “Stand back; I’m going to throw this straw down, and then I’ll come down myself.” When Simba stepped back out of the way, Bookoo threw down the straw, and as it lay on the ground Soongoora crept out and ran away while the lion was looking up.
After waiting a minute or two, Simba roared out, “Well, come down, I say!” and, there being no help for it, the big rat came down.
As soon as he was within reach, the lion caught hold of him, and asked, “Who was up there with you?”
“Why,” said Bookoo, “Soongoora, the hare. Didn’t you see him when I threw him down?”
“Of course I didn’t see him,” replied the lion, in an incredulous tone, and, without wasting further time, he ate the big rat, and then searched around for the hare, but could not find him.
Three days later, Soongoora called on his acquaintance, Ko′bay, the tortoise, and said to him, “Let us go and eat some honey.”
“Whose honey?” inquired Kobay, cautiously.
“My father’s,” Soongoora replied.
“Oh, all right; I’m with you,” said the tortoise, eagerly; and away they went.
When they arrived at the great calabash tree they climbed up with their straw, smoked out the bees, sat down, and began to eat.
Just then Mr. Simba, who owned the honey, came out again, and, looking up, inquired, “Who are you, up there?”
Soongoora whispered to Kobay, “Keep quiet;” but when the lion repeated his question angrily, Kobay became suspicious, and said: “I will speak. You told me this honey was yours; am I right in suspecting that it belongs to Simba?”
So, when the lion asked again, “Who are you?” he answered, “It’s only us.” The lion said, “Come down, then;” and the tortoise answered, “We’re coming.”
Now, Simba had been keeping an eye open for Soongoora since the day he caught Bookoo, the big rat, and, suspecting that he was up there with Kobay, he said to himself, “I’ve got him this time, sure.”
Seeing that they were caught again, Soongoora said to the tortoise: “Wrap me up in the straw, tell Simba to stand out of the way, and then throw me down. I’ll wait for you below. He can’t hurt you, you know.”
“All right,” said Kobay; but while he was wrapping the hare up he said to himself: “This fellow wants to run away, and leave me to bear the lion’s anger. He shall get caught first.” Therefore, when he had bundled him up, he called out, “Soongoora is coming!” and threw him down.
So Simba caught the hare, and, holding him with his paw, said, “Now, what shall I do with you?” The hare replied, “It’s of no use for you to try to eat me; I’m awfully tough.” “What would be the best thing to do with you, then?” asked Simba.
“I think,” said Soongoora, “you should take me by the tail, whirl me around, and knock me against the ground. Then you may be able to eat me.”
So the lion, being deceived, took him by the tail and whirled him around, but just as he was going to knock him on the ground he slipped out of his grasp and ran away, and Simba had the mortification of losing him again.
Angry and disappointed, he turned to the tree and called to Kobay, “You come down, too.”
When the tortoise reached the ground, the lion said, “You’re pretty hard; what can I do to make you eatable?”
“Oh, that’s easy,” laughed Kobay; “just put me in the mud and rub my back with your paw until my shell comes off.”
Immediately on hearing this, Simba carried Kobay to the water, placed him in the mud, and began, as he supposed, to rub his back; but the tortoise had slipped away, and the lion continued rubbing on a piece of rock until his paws were raw. When he glanced down at them he saw they were bleeding, and, realizing that he had again been outwitted, he said, “Well, the hare has done me to-day, but I’ll go hunting now until I find him.”
So Simba, the lion, set out immediately in search of Soongoora, the hare, and as he went along he inquired of every one he met, “Where is the house of Soongoora?” But each person he asked answered, “I do not know.” For the hare had said to his wife, “Let us remove from this house.” Therefore the folks in that neighborhood had no knowledge of his whereabouts. Simba, however, went along, continuing his inquiries, until presently one answered, “That is his house on the top of the mountain.”
Without loss of time the lion climbed the mountain, and soon arrived at the place indicated, only to find that there was no one at home. This, however, did not trouble him; on the contrary, saying to himself, “I’ll hide myself inside, and when Soongoora and his wife come home I’ll eat them both,” he entered the house and lay down, awaiting their arrival.
Pretty soon along came the hare with his wife, not thinking of any danger; but he very soon discovered the marks of the lion’s paws on the steep path. Stopping at once, he said to Mrs. Soongoora: “You go back, my dear. Simba, the lion, has passed this way, and I think he must be looking for me.”
But she replied, “I will not go back; I will follow you, my husband.”
Although greatly pleased at this proof of his wife’s affection, Soongoora said firmly: “No, no; you have friends to go to. Go back.”
So he persuaded her, and she went back; but he kept on, following the footmarks, and saw—as he had suspected—that they went into his house.
“Ah!” said he to himself, “Mr. Lion is inside, is he?” Then, cautiously going back a little way, he called out: “How d’ye do, house? How d’ye do?” Waiting a moment, he remarked loudly: “Well, this is very strange! Every day, as I pass this place, I say, ‘How d’ye do, house?’ and the house always answers, ‘How d’ye do?’ There must be some one inside to-day.”
When the lion heard this he called out, “How d’ye do?”
Then Soongoora burst out laughing, and shouted: “Oho, Mr. Simba! You’re inside, and I’ll bet you want to eat me; but first tell me where you ever heard of a house talking!”
Upon this the lion, seeing how he had been fooled, replied angrily, “You wait until I get hold of you; that’s all.”
“Oh, I think you’ll have to do the waiting,” cried the hare; and then he ran away, the lion following.
But it was of no use. Soongoora completely tired out old Simba, who, saying, “That rascal has beaten me; I don’t want to have anything more to do with him,” returned to his home under the great calabash tree.

Once upon a time all the streams and rivers ran so dry that the animals did not know how to get water. After a very long search, which had been quite in vain, they found a tiny spring, which only wanted to be dug deeper so as to yield plenty of water. So the beasts said to each other, ‘Let us dig a well, and then we shall not fear to die of thirst;’ and they all consented except the jackal, who hated work of any kind, and generally got somebody to do it for him.
When they had finished their well, they held a council as to who should be made the guardian of the well, so that the jackal might not come near it, for, they said, ‘he would not work, therefore he shall not drink.’
After some talk it was decided that the rabbit should be left in charge; then all the other beasts went back to their homes.
When they were out of sight the jackal arrived. ‘Good morning! Good morning, rabbit!’ and the rabbit politely said, ‘Good morning!’ Then the jackal unfastened the little bag that hung at his side, and pulled out of it a piece of honeycomb which he began to eat, and turning to the rabbit he remarked:
‘As you see, rabbit, I am not thirsty in the least, and this is nicer than any water.’
‘Give me a bit,’ asked the rabbit. So the jackal handed him a very little morsel.
‘Oh, how good it is!’ cried the rabbit; ‘give me a little more, dear friend!’
But the jackal answered, ‘If you really want me to give you some more, you must have your paws tied behind you, and lie on your back, so that I can pour it into your mouth.’
The rabbit did as he was bid, and when he was tied tight and popped on his back, the jackal ran to the spring and drank as much as he wanted. When he had quite finished he returned to his den.
In the evening the animals all came back, and when they saw the rabbit lying with his paws tied, they said to him: ‘Rabbit, how did you let yourself be taken in like this?’
‘It was all the fault of the jackal,’ replied the rabbit; ‘he tied me up like this, and told me he would give me something nice to eat. It was all a trick just to get at our water.’
‘Rabbit, you are no better than an idiot to have let the jackal drink our water when he would not help to find it. Who shall be our next watchman? We must have somebody a little sharper than you!’ and the little hare called out, ‘I will be the watchman.’
The following morning the animals all went their various ways, leaving the little hare to guard the spring. When they were out of sight the jackal came back. ‘Good morning! good morning, little hare,’ and the little hare politely said, ‘Good morning.’
‘Can you give me a pinch of snuff?’ said the jackal.
‘I am so sorry, but I have none,’ answered the little hare.
The jackal then came and sat down by the little hare, and unfastened his little bag, pulling out of it a piece of honeycomb. He licked his lips and exclaimed, ‘Oh, little hare, if you only knew how good it is!’
‘What is it?’ asked the little hare.
‘It is something that moistens my throat so deliciously,’ answered the jackal, ‘that after I have eaten it I don’t feel thirsty any more, while I am sure that all you other beasts are for ever wanting water.’
‘Give me a bit, dear friend,’ asked the little hare.
‘Not so fast,’ replied the jackal. ‘If you really wish to enjoy what you are eating, you must have your paws tied behind you, and lie on your back, so that I can pour it into your mouth.’
‘You can tie them, only be quick,’ said the little hare, and when he was tied tight and popped on his back, the jackal went quietly down to the well, and drank as much as he wanted. When he had quite finished he returned to his den.
In the evening the animals all came back; and when they saw the little hare with his paws tied, they said to him: ‘Little hare, how did you let yourself be taken in like this? Didn’t you boast you were very sharp? You undertook to guard our water; now show us how much is left for us to drink!’
‘It is all the fault of the jackal,’ replied the little hare. ‘He told me he would give me something nice to eat if I would just let him tie my hands behind my back.’
Then the animals said, ‘Who can we trust to mount guard now?’ And the panther answered, ‘Let it be the tortoise.’
The following morning the animals all went their various ways, leaving the tortoise to guard the spring. When they were out of sight the jackal came back. ‘Good morning, tortoise; good morning.’
But the tortoise took no notice.
‘Good morning, tortoise; good morning.’ But still the tortoise pretended not to hear.
Then the jackal said to himself, ‘Well, to-day I have only got to manage a bigger idiot than before. I shall just kick him on one side, and then go and have a drink.’ So he went up to the tortoise and said to him in a soft voice, ‘Tortoise! tortoise!’ but the tortoise took no notice. Then the jackal kicked him out of the way, and went to the well and began to drink, but scarcely had he touched the water, than the tortoise seized him by the leg. The jackal shrieked out: ‘Oh, you will break my leg!’ but the tortoise only held on the tighter. The jackal then took his bag and tried to make the tortoise smell the honeycomb he had inside; but the tortoise turned away his head and smelt nothing. At last the jackal said to the tortoise, ‘I should like to give you my bag and everything in it,’ but the only answer the tortoise made was to grasp the jackal’s leg tighter still.
So matters stood when the other animals came back. The moment he saw them, the jackal gave a violent tug, and managed to free his leg, and then took to his heels as fast as he could. And the animals all said to the tortoise:
‘Well done, tortoise, you have proved your courage; now we can drink from our well in peace, as you have got the better of that thieving jackal!’

There was once a dove who built a nice soft nest as a home for her three little ones. She was very proud of their beauty, and perhaps talked about them to her neighbours more than she need have done, till at last everybody for miles round knew where the three prettiest baby doves in the whole country-side were to be found.
One day a jackal who was prowling about in search of a dinner came by chance to the foot of the rock where the dove’s nest was hidden away, and he suddenly bethought himself that if he could get nothing better he might manage to make a mouthful of one of the young doves. So he shouted as loud as he could, ‘Ohe, ohe, mother dove.’
And the dove replied, trembling with fear, ‘What do you want, sir?’
‘One of your children,’ said he; ‘and if you don’t throw it to me I will eat up you and the others as well.’
Now, the dove was nearly driven distracted at the jackal’s words; but, in order to save the lives of the other two, she did at last throw the little one out of the nest. The jackal ate it up, and went home to sleep.
Meanwhile the mother dove sat on the edge of her nest, crying bitterly, when a heron, who was flying slowly past the rock, was filled with pity for her, and stopped to ask, ‘What is the matter, you poor dove?’
And the dove answered, ‘A jackal came by, and asked me to give him one of my little ones, and said that if I refused he would jump on my nest and eat us all up.’
But the heron replied, ‘You should not have believed him. He could never have jumped so high. He only deceived you because he wanted something for supper.’ And with these words the heron flew off.
He had hardly got out of sight when again the jackal came creeping slowly round the foot of the rock. And when he saw the dove he cried out a second time, ‘Ohe, ohe, mother dove! give me one of your little ones, or I will jump on your nest and eat you all up.’
This time the dove knew better, and she answered boldly, ‘Indeed, I shall do nothing of the sort,’ though her heart beat wildly with fear when she saw the jackal preparing for a spring.
However, he only cut himself against the rock, and thought he had better stick to threats, so he started again with his old cry, ‘Mother dove, mother dove! be quick and give me one of your little ones, or I will eat you all up.’
But the mother dove only answered as before, ‘Indeed, I shall do nothing of the sort, for I know we are safely out of your reach.’
The jackal felt it was quite hopeless to get what he wanted, and asked, ‘Tell me, mother dove, how have you suddenly become so wise?’
‘It was the heron who told me,’ replied she.
‘And which way did he go?’ said the jackal.
‘Down there among the reeds. You can see him if you look,’ said the dove.
Then the jackal nodded good-bye, and went quickly after the heron. He soon came up to the great bird, who was standing on a stone on the edge of the river watching for a nice fat fish. ‘Tell me, heron,’ said he, ‘when the wind blows from that quarter, to which side do you turn?’
‘And which side do you turn to?’ asked the heron.
The jackal answered, ‘I always turn to this side.’
‘Then that is the side I turn to,’ remarked the heron.
‘And when the rain comes from that quarter, which side do you turn to?’
And the heron replied, ‘And which side do you turn to?’
‘Oh, I always turn to this side,’ said the jackal.
‘Then that is the side I turn to,’ said the heron.
‘And when the rain comes straight down, what do you do?’
‘What do you do yourself?’ asked the heron.
‘I do this,’ answered the jackal. ‘I cover my head with my paws.’
‘Then that is what I do,’ said the heron. ‘I cover my head with my wings,’ and as he spoke he lifted his large wings and spread them completely over his head.
With one bound the jackal had seized him by the neck, and began to shake him.
‘Oh, have pity, have pity!’ cried the heron. ‘I never did you any harm.’
‘You told the dove how to get the better of me, and I am going to eat you for it.’
‘But if you will let me go,’ entreated the heron, ‘I will show you the place where the panther has her lair.’
‘Then you had better be quick about it,’ said the jackal, holding tight on to the heron until he had pointed out the panther’s den. ‘Now you may go, my friend, for there is plenty of food here for me.’
So the jackal came up to the panther, and asked politely, ‘Panther, would you like me to look after your children while you are out hunting?’
‘I should be very much obliged,’ said the panther; ‘but be sure you take care of them. They always cry all the time that I am away.’
So saying she trotted off, and the jackal marched into the cave, where he found ten little panthers, and instantly ate one up. By-and-bye the panther returned from hunting, and said to him, ‘Jackal, bring out my little ones for their supper.’
The jackal fetched them out one by one till he had brought out nine, and he took the last one and brought it out again, so the whole ten seemed to be there, and the panther was quite satisfied.
Next day she went again to the chase, and the jackal ate up another little panther, so now there were only eight. In the evening, when she came back, the panther said, ‘Jackal, bring out my little ones!’
And the jackal brought out first one and then another, and the last one he brought out three times, so that the whole ten seemed to be there.
The following day the same thing happened, and the next and the next and the next, till at length there was not even one left, and the rest of the day the jackal busied himself with digging a large hole at the back of the den.
That night, when the panther returned from hunting, she said to him as usual, ‘Jackal, bring out my little ones.’
But the jackal replied: ‘Bring out your little ones, indeed! Why, you know as well as I do that you have eaten them all up.’
Of course the panther had not the least idea what the jackal meant by this, and only repeated, ‘Jackal, bring out my children.’ As she got no answer she entered the cave, but found no jackal, for he had crawled through the hole he had made and escaped. And, what was worse, she did not find the little ones either.
Now the panther was not going to let the jackal get off like that, and set off at a trot to catch him. The jackal, however, had got a good start, and he reached a place where a swarm of bees deposited their honey in the cleft of a rock. Then he stood still and waited till the panther came up to him: ‘Jackal, where are my little ones?’ she asked.
And the jackal answered: ‘They are up there. It is where I keep school.’
The panther looked about, and then inquired, ‘But where? I see nothing of them.’
‘Come a little this way,’ said the jackal, ‘and you will hear how beautifully they sing.’
So the panther drew near the cleft of the rock.
‘Don’t you hear them?’ said the jackal; ‘they are in there,’ and slipped away while the panther was listening to the song of the children.
She was still standing in the same place when a baboon went by. ‘What are you doing there, panther?’
‘I am listening to my children singing. It is here that the jackal keeps his school.’
Then the baboon seized a stick, and poked it in the cleft of the rock, exclaiming, ‘Well, then, I should like to see your children!’
The bees flew out in a huge swarm, and made furiously for the panther, whom they attacked on all sides, while the baboon soon climbed up out of the way, crying, as he perched himself on the branch of a tree, ‘I wish you joy of your children!’ while from afar the jackal’s voice was heard exclaiming: ‘Sting, her well! don’t let her go!’
The panther galloped away as if she was mad, and flung herself into the nearest lake, but every time she raised her head, the bees stung her afresh so at last the poor beast was drowned altogether.

One day Koongoo′roo, sultan of the crows, sent a letter to Mway′way, sultan of the kites, containing these few words: “I want you folks to be my soldiers.”
To this brief message Mwayway at once wrote this short reply: “I should say not.”
Thereupon, thinking to scare Mwayway, the sultan of the crows sent him word, “If you refuse to obey me I’ll make war upon you.”
To which the sultan of the kites replied, “That suits me; let us fight, and if you beat us we will obey you, but if we are victors you shall be our servants.”
So they gathered their forces and engaged in a great battle, and in a little while it became evident that the crows were being badly beaten.
As it appeared certain that, if something were not done pretty quickly, they would all be killed, one old crow, named Jeeoo′see, suddenly proposed that they should fly away.
Directly the suggestion was made it was acted upon, and the crows left their homes and flew far away, where they set up another town. So, when the kites entered the place, they found no one there, and they took up their residence in Crowtown.
One day, when the crows had gathered in council, Koongooroo stood up and said: “My people, do as I command you, and all will be well. Pluck out some of my feathers and throw me into the town of the kites; then come back and stay here until you hear from me.”
Without argument or questioning the crows obeyed their sultan’s command.
Koongooroo had lain in the street but a short time, when some passing kites saw him and inquired threateningly, “What are you doing here in our town?”
With many a moan he replied, “My companions have beaten me and turned me out of their town because I advised them to obey Mwayway, sultan of the kites.”
When they heard this they picked him up and took him before the sultan, to whom they said, “We found this fellow lying in the street, and he attributes his involuntary presence in our town to so singular a circumstance that we thought you should hear his story.”
Koongooroo was then bidden to repeat his statement, which he did, adding the remark that, much as he had suffered, he still held to his opinion that Mwayway was his rightful sultan.
This, of course, made a very favorable impression, and the sultan said, “You have more sense than all the rest of your tribe put together; I guess you can stay here and live with us.”
So Koongooroo, expressing much gratitude, settled down, apparently, to spend the remainder of his life with the kites.
One day his neighbors took him to church with them, and when they returned home they asked him, “Who have the best kind of religion, the kites or the crows?”
To which crafty old Koongooroo replied, with great enthusiasm, “Oh, the kites, by long odds!”
This answer tickled the kites like anything, and Koongooroo was looked upon as a bird of remarkable discernment.
When almost another week had passed, the sultan of the crows slipped away in the night, went to his own town, and called his people together.
“To-morrow,” said he, “is the great annual religious festival of the kites, and they will all go to church in the morning. Go, now, and get some wood and some fire, and wait near their town until I call you; then come quickly and set fire to the church.”
Then he hurried back to Mwayway’s town.
The crows were very busy indeed all that night, and by dawn they had an abundance of wood and fire at hand, and were lying in wait near the town of their victorious enemies.
So in the morning every kite went to church. There was not one person left at home except old Koongooroo.
When his neighbors called for him they found him lying down. “Why!” they exclaimed with surprise, “are you not going to church to-day?”
“Oh,” said he, “I wish I could; but my stomach aches so badly I can’t move!” And he groaned dreadfully.
“Ah, poor fellow!” said they; “you will be better in bed;” and they left him to himself.
As soon as everybody was out of sight he flew swiftly to his soldiers and cried, “Come on; they’re all in the church.”
Then they all crept quickly but quietly to the church, and while some piled wood about the door, others applied fire.
The wood caught readily, and the fire was burning fiercely before the kites were aware of their danger; but when the church began to fill with smoke, and tongues of flame shot through the cracks, they tried to escape through the windows. The greater part of them, however, were suffocated, or, having their wings singed, could not fly away, and so were burned to death, among them their sultan, Mwayway; and Koongooroo and his crows got their old town back again.
From that day to this the kites fly away from the crows.

A long, long way off, in a land where water is very scarce, there lived a man and his wife and several children. One day the wife said to her husband, ‘I am pining to have the liver of a nyamatsane for my dinner. If you love me as much as you say you do, you will go out and hunt for a nyamatsane, and will kill it and get its liver. If not, I shall know that your love is not worth having.’
‘Bake some bread,’ was all her husband answered, ‘then take the crust and put it in this little bag.’
The wife did as she was told, and when she had finished she said to her husband, ‘The bag is all ready and quite full.’
‘Very well,’ said he, ‘and now good-bye; I am going after the nyamatsane.’
But the nyamatsane was not so easy to find as the woman had hoped. The husband walked on and on and on without ever seeing one, and every now and then he felt so hungry that he was obliged to eat one of the crusts of bread out of his bag. At last, when he was ready to drop from fatigue, he found himself on the edge of a great marsh, which bordered on one side the country of the nyamatsanes. But there were no more nyamatsanes here than anywhere else. They had all gone on a hunting expedition, as their larder was empty, and the only person left at home was their grandmother, who was so feeble she never went out of the house. Our friend looked on this as a great piece of luck, and made haste to kill her before the others returned, and to take out her liver, after which he dressed himself in her skin as well as he could. He had scarcely done this when he heard the noise of the nyamatsanes coming back to their grandmother, for they were very fond of her, and never stayed away from her longer than they could help. They rushed clattering into the hut, exclaiming, ‘We smell human flesh! Some man is here,’ and began to look about for him; but they only saw their old grandmother, who answered, in a trembling voice, ‘No, my children, no! What should any man be doing here?’ The nyamatsanes paid no attention to her, and began to open all the cupboards, and peep under all the beds, crying out all the while, ‘A man is here! a man is here!’ but they could find nobody, and at length, tired out with their long day’s hunting, they curled themselves up and fell asleep.
Next morning they woke up quite refreshed, and made ready to start on another expedition; but as they did not feel happy about their grandmother they said to her, ‘Grandmother, won’t you come to-day and feed with us?’ And they led their grandmother outside, and all of them began hungrily to eat pebbles. Our friend pretended to do the same, but in reality he slipped the stones into his pouch, and swallowed the crusts of bread instead. However, as the nyamatsanes did not see this they had no idea that he was not really their grandmother. When they had eaten a great many pebbles they thought they had done enough for that day, and all went home together and curled themselves up to sleep. Next morning when they woke they said, ‘Let us go and amuse ourselves by jumping over the ditch,’ and every time they cleared it with a bound. Then they begged their grandmother to jump over it too, end with a tremendous effort she managed to spring right over to the other side. After this they had no doubt at all of its being their true grandmother, and went off to their hunting, leaving our friend at home in the hut.
As soon as they had gone out of sight our hero made haste to take the liver from the place where he had hid it, threw off the skin of the old nyamatsane, and ran away as hard as he could, only stopping to pick up a very brilliant and polished little stone, which he put in his bag by the side of the liver.
Towards evening the nyamatsanes came back to the hut full of anxiety to know how their grandmother had got on during their absence. The first thing they saw on entering the door was her skin lying on the floor, and then they knew that they had been deceived, and they said to each other, ‘So we were right, after all, and it was human flesh we smelt.’ Then they stooped down to find traces of the man’s footsteps, and when they had got them instantly set out in hot pursuit.
Meanwhile our friend had journeyed many miles, and was beginning to feel quite safe and comfortable, when, happening to look round, he saw in the distance a thick cloud of dust moving rapidly. His heart stood still within him, and he said to himself, ‘I am lost. It is the nyamatsanes, and they will tear me in pieces,’ and indeed the cloud of dust was drawing near with amazing quickness, and the nyamatsanes almost felt as if they were already devouring him. Then as a last hope the man took the little stone that he had picked up out of his bag and flung it on the ground. The moment it touched the soil it became a huge rock, whose steep sides were smooth as glass, and on the top of it our hero hastily seated himself. It was in vain that the nyamatsanes tried to climb up and reach him; they slid down again much faster than they had gone up; and by sunset they were quite worn out, and fell asleep at the foot of the rock.
No sooner had the nyamatsanes tumbled off to sleep than the man stole softly down and fled away as fast as his legs would carry him, and by the time his enemies were awake he was a very long way off. They sprang quickly to their feet and began to sniff the soil round the rock, in order to discover traces of his footsteps, and they galloped after him with terrific speed. The chase continued for several days and nights; several times the nyamatsanes almost reached him, and each time he was saved by his little pebble.
Between his fright and his hurry he was almost dead of exhaustion when he reached his own village, where the nyamatsanes could not follow him, because of their enemies the dogs, which swarmed over all the roads. So they returned home.
Then our friend staggered into his own hut and called to his wife: ‘Ichou! how tired I am! Quick, give me something to drink. Then go and get fuel and light a fire.’
So she did what she was bid, and then her husband took the nyamatsane’s liver from his pouch and said to her, ‘There, I have brought you what you wanted, and now you know that I love you truly.’
And the wife answered, ‘It is well. Now go and take out the children, so that I may remain alone in the hut,’ and as she spoke she lifted down an old stone pot and put on the liver to cook. Her husband watched her for a moment, and then said, ‘Be sure you eat it all yourself. Do not give a scrap to any of the children, but eat every morsel up.’ So the woman took the liver and ate it all herself.
Directly the last mouthful had disappeared she was seized with such violent thirst that she caught up a great pot full of water and drank it at a single draught. Then, having no more in the house, she ran in next door and said, ‘Neighbour, give me, I pray you, something to drink.’ The neighbour gave her a large vessel quite full, and the woman drank it off at a single draught, and held it out for more.
But the neighbour pushed her away, saying, ‘No, I shall have none left for my children.’
So the woman went into another house, and drank all the water she could find; but the more she drank the more thirsty she became. She wandered in this manner through the whole village till she had drunk every water-pot dry. Then she rushed off to the nearest spring, and swallowed that, and when she had finished all the springs and wells about she drank up first the river and then a lake. But by this time she had drunk so much that she could not rise from the ground.
In the evening, when it was time for the animals to have their drink before going to bed, they found the lake quite dry, and they had to make up their minds to be thirsty till the water flowed again and the streams were full. Even then, for some time, the lake was very dirty, and the lion, as king of the beasts, commanded that no one should drink till it was quite clear again.
But the little hare, who was fond of having his own way, and was very thirsty besides, stole quietly off when all the rest were asleep in their dens, and crept down to the margin of the lake and drank his fill. Then he smeared the dirty water all over the rabbit’s face and paws, so that it might look as if it were he who had been disobeying Big Lion’s orders.
The next day, as soon as it was light, Big Lion marched straight for the lake, and all the other beasts followed him. He saw at once that the water had been troubled again, and was very angry.
‘Who has been drinking my water?’ said he; and the little hare gave a jump, and, pointing to the rabbit, he answered, ‘Look there! it must be he! Why, there is mud all over his face and paws!’
The rabbit, frightened out of his wits, tried to deny the fact, exclaiming, ‘Oh, no, indeed I never did;’ but Big Lion would not listen, and commanded them to cane him with a birch rod.
Now the little hare was very much pleased with his cleverness in causing the rabbit to be beaten instead of himself, and went about boasting of it. At last one of the other animals overheard him, and called out, ‘Little hare, little hare! what is that you are saying?’
But the little hare hastily replied, ‘I only asked you to pass me my stick.’
An hour or two later, thinking that no one was near him, he said to himself again, ‘It was really I who drank up the water, but I made them think it was the rabbit.’
But one of the beasts whose ears were longer than the rest caught the words, and went to tell Big Lion about it. Do you hear what the little hare is saying?’
So Big Lion sent for the little hare, and asked him what he meant by talking like that.
The little hare saw that there was no use trying to hide it, so he answered pertly, ‘It was I who drank the water, but I made them think it was the rabbit.’ Then he turned and ran as fast as he could, with all the other beasts pursuing him.
They were almost up to him when he dashed into a very narrow cleft in the rock, much too small for them to follow; but in his hurry he had left one of his long ears sticking out, which they just managed to seize. But pull as hard as they might they could not drag him out of the hole, and at last they gave it up and left him, with his ear very much torn and scratched.
When the last tail was out of sight the little hare crept cautiously out, and the first person he met was the rabbit. He had plenty of impudence, so he put a bold face on the matter, and said, ‘Well, my good rabbit, you see I have had a beating as well as you.’
But the rabbit was still sore and sulky, and he did not care to talk, so he answered, coldly, ‘You have treated me very badly. It was really you who drank that water, and you accused me of having done it.’
‘Oh, my good rabbit, never mind that! I’ve got such a wonderful secret to tell you! Do you know what to do so as to escape death?’
‘No, I don’t.’
‘Well, we must begin by digging a hole.’
So they dug a hole, and then the little hare said, ‘The next thing is to make a fire in the hole,’ and they set to work to collect wood, and lit quite a large fire.
When it was burning brightly the little hare said to the rabbit, ‘Rabbit, my friend, throw me into the fire, and when you hear my fur crackling, and I call “Itchi, Itchi,” then be quick and pull me out.’
The rabbit did as he was told, and threw the little hare into the fire; but no sooner did the little hare begin to feel the heat of the flames than he took some green bay leaves he had plucked for the purpose and held them in the middle of the fire, where they crackled and made a great noise. Then he called loudly ‘Itchi, Itchi! Rabbit, my friend, be quick, be quick! Don’t you hear how my skin is crackling?’
And the rabbit came in a great hurry and pulled him out.
Then the little hare said, ‘Now it is your turn!’ and he threw the rabbit in the fire. The moment the rabbit felt the flames he cried out ‘Itchi, Itchi, I am burning; pull me out quick, my friend!’
But the little hare only laughed, and said, ‘No, you may stay there! It is your own fault. Why were you such a fool as to let yourself be thrown in? Didn’t you know that fire burns?’ And in a very few minutes nothing was left of the rabbit but a few bones.
When the fire was quite out the little hare went and picked up one of these bones, and made a flute out of it, and sang this song:
Pii, pii, O flute that I love, Pii, pii, rabbits are but little boys. Pii, pii, he would have burned me if he could; Pii, pii, but I burned him, and he crackled finely.
When he got tired of going through the world singing this the little hare went back to his friends and entered the service of Big Lion. One day he said to his master, ‘Grandfather, shall I show you a splendid way to kill game?’
‘What is it?’ asked Big Lion.
‘We must dig a ditch, and then you must lie in it and pretend to be dead.’
Big Lion did as he was told, and when he had lain down the little hare got up on a wall blew a trumpet and shouted—
Pii, pii, all you animals come and see, Big Lion is dead, and now peace will be.
Directly they heard this they all came running. The little hare received them and said, ‘Pass on, this way to the lion.’ So they all entered into the Animal Kingdom. Last of all came the monkey with her baby on her back. She approached the ditch, and took a blade of grass and tickled Big Lion’s nose, and his nostrils moved in spite of his efforts to keep them still. Then the monkey cried, ‘Come, my baby, climb on my back and let us go. What sort of a dead body is it that can still feel when it is tickled?’ And she and her baby went away in a fright. Then the little hare said to the other beasts, ‘Now, shut the gate of the Animal Kingdom.’ And it was shut, and great stones were rolled against it. When everything was tight closed the little hare turned to Big Lion and said ‘Now!’ and Big Lion bounded out of the ditch and tore the other animals in pieces.
But Big Lion kept all the choice bits for himself, and only gave away the little scraps that he did not care about eating; and the little hare grew very angry, and determined to have his revenge. He had long ago found out that Big Lion was very easily taken in; so he laid his plans accordingly. He said to him, as if the idea had just come into his head, ‘Grandfather, let us build a hut,’ and Big Lion consented. And when they had driven the stakes into the ground, and had made the walls of the hut, the little hare told Big Lion to climb upon the top while he stayed inside. When he was ready he called out, ‘Now, grandfather, begin,’ and Big Lion passed his rod through the reeds with which the roofs are always covered in that country. The little hare took it and cried, ‘Now it is my turn to pierce them,’ and as he spoke he passed the rod back through the reeds and gave Big Lion’s tail a sharp poke.
‘What is pricking me so?’ asked Big Lion.
‘Oh, just a little branch sticking out. I am going to break it,’ answered the little hare; but of course he had done it on purpose, as he wanted to fix Big Lion’s tail so firmly to the hut that he would not be able to move. In a little while he gave another prick, and Big Lion called again, ‘What is pricking me so?’
This time the little hare said to himself, ‘He will find out what I am at. I must try some other plan. ‘So he called out, ‘Grandfather, you had better put your tongue here, so that the branches shall not touch you.’ Big Lion did as he was bid, and the little hare tied it tightly to the stakes of the wall. Then he went outside and shouted, ‘Grandfather, you can come down now,’ and Big Lion tried, but he could not move an inch.
Then the little hare began quietly to eat Big Lion’s dinner right before his eyes, and paying no attention at all to his growls of rage. When he had quite done he climbed up on the hut, and, blowing his flute, he chanted ‘Pii, pii, fall rain and hail,’ and directly the sky was full of clouds, the thunder roared, and huge hailstones whitened the roof of the hut. The little hare, who had taken refuge within, called out again, ‘Big Lion, be quick and come down and dine with me.’ But there was no answer, not even a growl, for the hailstones had killed Big Lion.
The little hare enjoyed himself vastly for some time, living comfortably in the hut, with plenty of food to eat and no trouble at all in getting it. But one day a great wind arose, and flung down the Big Lion’s half-dried skin from the roof of the hut. The little hare bounded with terror at the noise, for he thought Big Lion must have come to life again; but on discovering what had happened he set about cleaning the skin, and propped the mouth open with sticks so that he could get through. So, dressed in Big Lion’s skin, the little hare started on his travels.
The first visit he paid was to the hyaenas, who trembled at the sight of him, and whispered to each other, ‘How shall we escape from this terrible beast?’ Meanwhile the little hare did not trouble himself about them, but just asked where the king of the hyaenas lived, and made himself quite at home there. Every morning each hyaena thought to himself, ‘To-day he is certain to eat me;’ but several days went by, and they were all still alive. At length, one evening, the little hare, looking round for something to amuse him, noticed a great pot full of boiling water, so he strolled up to one of the hyaenas and said, ‘Go and get in.’ The hyaena dared not disobey, and in a few minutes was scalded to death. Then the little hare went the round of the village, saying to every hyaena he met, ‘Go and get into the boiling water,’ so that in a little while there was hardly a male left in the village.
One day all the hyaenas that remained alive went out very early into the fields, leaving only one little daughter at home. The little hare, thinking he was all alone, came into the enclosure, and, wishing to feel what it was like to be a hare again, threw off Big Lion’s skin, and began to jump and dance, singing—
I am just the little hare, the little hare, the little hare; I am just the little hare who killed the great hyaenas.
The little hyaena gazed at him in surprise, saying to herself, ‘What! was it really this tiny beast who put to death all our best people?’ when suddenly a gust of wind rustled the reeds that surrounded the enclosure, and the little hare, in a fright, hastily sprang back into Big Lion’s skin.
When the hyaenas returned to their homes the little hyaena said to her father: ‘Father, our tribe has very nearly been swept away, and all this has been the work of a tiny creature dressed in the lion’s skin.’
But her father answered, ‘Oh, my dear child, you don’t know what you are talking about.’
She replied, ‘Yes, father, it is quite true. I saw it with my own eyes.’
The father did not know what to think, and told one of his friends, who said, ‘To-morrow we had better keep watch ourselves.’
And the next day they hid themselves and waited till the little hare came out of the royal hut. He walked gaily towards the enclosure, threw off, Big Lion’s skin, and sang and danced as before—
I am just the little hare, the little hare, the little hare, I am just the little hare, who killed the great hyaenas.
That night the two hyaenas told all the rest, saying, ‘Do you know that we have allowed ourselves to be trampled on by a wretched creature with nothing of the lion about him but his skin?’
When supper was being cooked that evening, before they all went to bed, the little hare, looking fierce and terrible in Big Lion’s skin, said as usual to one of the hyaenas ‘Go and get into the boiling water.’ But the hyaena never stirred. There was silence for a moment; then a hyaena took a stone, and flung it with all his force against the lion’s skin. The little hare jumped out through the mouth with a single spring, and fled away like lightning, all the hyaenas in full pursuit uttering great cries. As he turned a corner the little hare cut off both his ears, so that they should not know him, and pretended to be working at a grindstone which lay there.
The hyaenas soon came up to him and said, ‘Tell me, friend, have you seen the little hare go by?’
‘No, I have seen no one.’
‘Where can he be?’ said the hyaenas one to another. ‘Of course, this creature is quite different, and not at all like the little hare.’ Then they went on their way, but, finding no traces of the little hare, they returned sadly to their village, saying, ‘To think we should have allowed ourselves to be swept away by a wretched creature like that!’

Once upon a time Sim′ba, the lion, Fee′see, the hyena, and Keetee′tee, the rabbit, made up their minds to go in for a little farming. So they went into the country, made a garden, planted all kinds of seeds, and then came home and rested quite a while.
Then, when the time came when their crops should be about ripe and ready for harvesting, they began to say to each other, “Let’s go over to the farm, and see how our crops are coming along.”
So one morning, early, they started, and, as the garden was a long way off, Keeteetee, the rabbit, made this proposition: “While we are going to the farm, let us not stop on the road; and if any one does stop, let him be eaten.” His companions, not being so cunning as he, and knowing they could outwalk him, readily consented to this arrangement.
“The lion, the hyena and the rabbit go in for a little farming.” Illustration by Walter Bobbett, published in Zanzibar Tales: Told by Natives of the East Coast of Africa by George Batema (1901), A.C. McClurg and Co.
Well, off they went; but they had not gone very far when the rabbit stopped.
“Hullo!” said Feesee, the hyena; “Keeteetee has stopped. He must be eaten.”
“That’s the bargain,” agreed Simba, the lion.
“Well,” said the rabbit, “I happened to be thinking.”
“What about?” cried his partners, with great curiosity.
“I’m thinking,” said he, with a grave, philosophical air, “about those two stones, one big and one little; the little one does not go up, nor does the big one go down.”
The lion and the hyena, having stopped to look at the stones, could only say, “Why, really, it’s singular; but it’s just as you say;” and they all resumed their journey, the rabbit being by this time well rested.
When they had gone some distance the rabbit stopped again.
“Aha!” said Feesee; “Keeteetee has stopped again. Now he must be eaten.”
“I rather think so,” assented Simba.
“Well,” said the rabbit, “I was thinking again.”
Their curiosity once more aroused, his comrades begged him to tell them his think.
“Why,” said he, “I was thinking this: When people like us put on new coats, where do the old ones go to?”
Both Simba and Feesee, having stopped a moment to consider the matter, exclaimed together, “Well, I wonder!” and the three went on, the rabbit having again had a good rest.
After a little while the hyena, thinking it about time to show off a little of his philosophy, suddenly stopped.
“Here,” growled Simba, “this won’t do; I guess we’ll have to eat you, Feesee.”
“Oh, no,” said the hyena; “I’m thinking.”
“What are you thinking about?” they inquired.
“I’m thinking about nothing at all,” said he, imagining himself very smart and witty.
“Ah, pshaw!” cried Keeteetee; “we won’t be fooled that way.”
So he and Simba ate the hyena.
When they had finished eating their friend, the lion and the rabbit proceeded on their way, and presently came to a place where there was a cave, and here the rabbit stopped.
“H’m!” ejaculated Simba; “I’m not so hungry as I was this morning, but I guess I’ll have to find room for you, little Keeteetee.”
“Oh, I believe not,” replied Keeteetee; “I’m thinking again.”
“Well,” said the lion, “what is it this time?”
Said the rabbit: “I’m thinking about that cave. In olden times our ancestors used to go in here, and go out there, and I think I’ll try and follow in their footsteps.”
So he went in at one end and out at the other end several times.
Then he said to the lion, “Simba, old fellow, let’s see you try to do that;” and the lion went into the cave, but he stuck fast, and could neither go forward nor back out.
In a moment Keeteetee was on Simba’s back, and began eating him.
After a little time the lion cried, “Oh, brother, be impartial; come and eat some of the front part of me.”
But the rabbit replied, “Indeed, I can’t come around in front; I’m ashamed to look you in the face.”
So, having eaten all he was able to, he left the lion there, and went and became sole owner of the farm and its crops.

Once upon a time, there lived a woman who had a son and a daughter. One morning she said to them: ‘I have heard of a town where there is no such thing as death: let us go and dwell there.’ So she broke up her house, and went away with her son and daughter.
When she reached the city, the first thing she did was to look about and see if there was any churchyard, and when she found none, she exclaimed, ‘This is a delightful spot. We will stay here for ever.’
By-and-by, her son grew to be a man, and he took for a wife a girl who had been born in the town. But after a little while he grew restless, and went away on his travels, leaving his mother, his wife, and his sister behind him.
He had not been gone many weeks when one evening his mother said, ‘I am not well, my head aches dreadfully.’
‘What did you say?’ inquired her daughter-in-law.
‘My head feels ready to split,’ replied the old woman.
The daughter-in-law asked no more questions, but left the house, and went in haste to some butchers in the next street.
‘I have got a woman to sell; what will you give me for her?’ said she.
The butchers answered that they must see the woman first, and they all returned together.
Then the butchers took the woman and told her they must kill her.
‘But why?’ she asked.
‘Because,’ they said, ‘it is always our custom that when persons are ill and complain of their head they should be killed at once. It is a much better way than leaving them to die a natural death.’
‘Very well,’ replied the woman. ‘But leave, I pray you, my lungs and my liver untouched, till my son comes back. Then give both to him.’
But the men took them out at once, and gave them to the daughter-in-law, saying: ‘Put away these things till your husband returns.’ And the daughter-in-law took them, and hid them in a secret place.
When the old woman’s daughter, who had been in the woods, heard that her mother had been killed while she was out, she was filled with fright, and ran away as fast as she could. At last she reached a lonely spot far from the town, where she thought she was safe, and sat down on a stone, and wept bitterly. As she was sitting, sobbing, a man passed by.
‘What is the matter, little girl? Answer me! I will be your friend.’
‘Ah, sir, they have killed my mother; my brother is far away, and I have nobody.’
‘Will you come with me?’ asked the man.
‘Thankfully,’ said she, and he led her down, down, under the earth, till they reached a great city. Then he married her, and in course of time she had a son. And the baby was known throughout the city as ‘Mohammed with the magic finger,’ because, whenever he stuck out his little finger, he was able to see anything that was happening for as far as two days’ distance.
By-and-by, as the boy was growing bigger, his uncle returned from his long journey, and went straight to his wife.
‘Where are my mother and sister?’ he asked; but his wife answered: ‘Have something to eat first, and then I will tell you.’
But he replied: ‘How can I eat till I know what has become of them?’
Then she fetched, from the upper chamber, a box full of money, which she laid before him, saying, ‘That is the price of your mother. She sold well.’
‘What do you mean?’ he gasped.
‘Oh, your mother complained one day that her head was aching, so I got in two butchers and they agreed to take her. However, I have got her lungs and liver hidden, till you came back, in a safe place.’
‘And my sister?’
‘Well, while the people were chopping up your mother she ran away, and I heard no more of her.’
‘Give me my mother’s liver and lungs,’ said the young man. And she gave them to him. Then he put them in his pocket, and went away, saying: ‘I can stay no longer in this horrible town. I go to seek my sister.’
Now, one day, the little boy stretched out his finger and said to his mother, ‘My uncle is coming!’
‘Where is he?’ she asked.
‘He is still two days’ journey off: looking for us; but he will soon be here.’ And in two days, as the boy had foretold, the uncle had found the hole in the earth, and arrived at the gate of the city. All his money was spent, and not knowing where his sister lived, he began to beg of all the people he saw.
‘Here comes my uncle,’ called out the little boy. ‘Where?’ asked his mother. ‘Here at the house door;’ and the woman ran out and embraced him, and wept over him. When they could both speak, he said: ‘My sister, were you by when they killed my mother?’
‘I was absent when they slew her,’ replied she, ‘and as I could do nothing, I ran away. But you, my brother, how did you get here?’
‘By chance,’ he said, ‘after I had wandered far; but I did not know I should find you!’ ‘My little boy told me you were coming,’ she explained, ‘when you were yet two days distant; he alone of all men has that great gift.’
But she did not tell him that her husband could change himself into a serpent, a dog, or a monster, whenever he pleased. He was a very rich man, and possessed large herds of camels, goats, sheep, cattle, horses and asses; all the best of their kind. And the next morning, the sister said: ‘Dear brother, go and watch our sheep, and when you are thirsty, drink their milk!’
‘Very well,’ answered he, and he went.
Soon after, she said again, ‘Dear brother, go and watch our goats.’
‘But why? I like tending sheep better!’
‘Oh, it is much nicer to be a goatherd,’ she said; so he took the goats out.
When he was gone, she said to her husband, ‘You must kill my brother, for I cannot have him living here with me.’
‘But, my dear, why should I? He has done me no harm.’
‘I wish you to kill him,’ she answered, ‘or if not I will leave.’
‘Oh, all right, then,’ said he; ‘to-morrow I will change myself into a serpent, and hide myself in the date barrel; and when he comes to fetch dates I will sting him in the hand.’
‘That will do very well,’ said she.
When the sun was up next day, she called to her brother, ‘Go and mind the goats.’
‘Yes, of course,’ he replied; but the little boy called out: ‘Uncle, I want to come with you.’
‘Delighted,’ said the uncle, and they started together.
After they had got out of sight of the house the boy said to him, ‘Dear uncle, my father is going to kill you. He has changed himself into a serpent, and has hidden himself in the date barrel. My mother has told him to do it.’
‘And what am I to do?’ asked the uncle.
‘I will tell you. When we bring the goats back to the house, and my mother says to you, “I am sure you must be hungry: get a few dates out of the cask,” just say to me, “I am not feeling very well, Mohammed, you go and get them for me.”‘
So, when they reached the house the sister came out to meet them, saying, ‘Dear brother, you must certainly be hungry: go and get a few dates.’
But he answered, ‘I am not feeling very well. Mohammed, you go and get them for me.’
‘Of course I will,’ replied the little boy, and ran at once to the cask.
‘No, no,’ his mother called after him; ‘come here directly! Let your uncle fetch them himself!’
But the boy would not listen, and crying out to her ‘I would rather get them,’ thrust his hand into the date cask.
Instead of the fruit, it struck against something cold and slimy, and he whispered softly, ‘Keep still; it is I, your son!’
Then he picked up his dates and went away to his uncle.
‘Here they are, dear uncle; eat as many as you want.’
And his uncle ate them.
When he saw that the uncle did not mean to come near the cask, the serpent crawled out and regained his proper shape.
‘I am thankful I did not kill him,’ he said to his wife; ‘for, after all, he is my brother-in-law, and it would have been a great sin!’
‘Either you kill him or I leave you,’ said she.
‘Well, well!’ sighed the man, ‘to-morrow I will do it.’
The woman let that night go by without doing anything further, but at daybreak she said to her brother, ‘Get up, brother; it is time to take the goats to pasture!’
‘All right,’ cried he.
‘I will come with you, uncle,’ called out the little boy.
‘Yes, come along,’ replied he.
But the mother ran up, saying, ‘The child must not go out in this cold or he will be ill;’ to which he only answered, ‘Nonsense! I am going, so it is no use your talking! I am going! I am! I am!’
‘Then go!’ she said.
And so they started, driving the goats in front of them.
When they reached the pasture the boy said to his uncle: ‘Dear uncle, this night my father means to kill you. While we are away he will creep into your room and hide in the straw. Directly we get home my mother will say to you, “Take that straw and give it to the sheep,” and, if you do, he will bite you.’
‘Then what am I to do?’ asked the man.
‘Oh, do not be afraid, dear uncle! I will kill my father myself.’
‘All right,’ replied the uncle.
As they drove back the goats towards the house, the sister cried: ‘Be quick, dear brother, go and get me some straw for the sheep.’
‘Let me go,’ said the boy.
‘You are not big enough; your uncle will get it,’ replied she.
‘We will both get it,’ answered the boy; ‘come, uncle, let us go and fetch that straw!’
‘All right,’ replied the uncle, and they went to the door of the room.
‘It seems very dark,’ said the boy; ‘I must go and get a light;’ and when he came back with one, he set fire to the straw, and the serpent was burnt.
Then the mother broke into sobs and tears. ‘Oh, you wretched boy! What have you done? Your father was in that straw, and you have killed him!’
‘Now, how was I to know that my father was lying in that straw, instead of in the kitchen?’ said the boy.
But his mother only wept the more, and sobbed out, ‘From this day you have no father. You must do without him as best you can!’
‘Why did you marry a serpent?’ asked the boy. ‘I thought he was a man! How did he learn those odd tricks?’
As the sun rose, she woke her brother, and said, ‘Go and take the goats to pasture!’
‘I will come too,’ said the little boy.
‘Go then!’ said his mother, and they went together.
On the way the boy began: ‘Dear uncle, this night my mother means to kill both of us, by poisoning us with the bones of the serpent, which she will grind to powder and sprinkle in our food.’
‘And what are we to do?’ asked the uncle.
‘I will kill her, dear uncle. I do not want either a father or a mother like that!’
When they came home in the evening they saw the woman preparing supper, and secretly scattering the powdered bones of the serpent on one side of the dish. On the other, where she meant to eat herself, there was no poison.
And the boy whispered to his uncle, ‘Dear uncle, be sure you eat from the same side of the dish as I do!’
‘All right,’ said the uncle.
So they all three sat down to the table, but before they helped themselves the boy said, ‘I am thirsty, mother; will you get me some milk?’
‘Very well,’ said she, ‘but you had better begin your supper.’
And when she came back with the milk they were both eating busily.
‘Sit down and have something too,’ said the boy, and she sat down and helped herself from the dish, but at the very first moment she sank dead upon the ground.
‘She has got what she meant for us,’ observed the boy; ‘and now we will sell all the sheep and cattle.’
So the sheep and cattle were sold, and the uncle and nephew took the money and went to see the world.
For ten days they travelled through the desert, and then they came to a place where the road parted in two.
‘Uncle!’ said the boy.
‘Well, what is it?’ replied he.
‘You see these two roads? You must take one, and I the other; for the time has come when we must part.’
But the uncle cried, ‘No, no, my boy, we will keep together always.’
‘Alas! that cannot be,’ said the boy; ‘so tell me which way you will go.’
‘I will go to the west,’ said the uncle.
‘One word before I leave you,’ continued the boy. ‘Beware of any man who has red hair and blue eyes. Take no service under him.’
‘All right,’ replied the uncle, and they parted.
For three days the man wandered on without any food, till he was very hungry. Then, when he was almost fainting, a stranger met him and said, ‘Will you work for me?’
‘By contract?’ asked the man.
‘Yes, by contract,’ replied the stranger, ‘and whichever of us breaks it, shall have a strip of skin taken from his body.’
‘All right,’ replied the man; ‘what shall I have to do?’
‘Every day you must take the sheep out to pasture, and carry my old mother on your shoulders, taking great care her feet shall never touch the ground. And, besides that, you must catch, every evening, seven singing birds for my seven sons.’
‘That is easily done,’ said the man.
Then they went back together, and the stranger said, ‘Here are your sheep; and now stoop down, and let my mother climb on your back.’
‘Very good,’ answered Mohammed’s uncle.
The new shepherd did as he was told, and returned in the evening with the old woman on his back, and the seven singing birds in his pocket, which he gave to the seven boys, when they came to meet him. So the days passed, each one exactly like the other.
At last, one night, he began to weep, and cried: ‘Oh, what have I done, that I should have to perform such hateful tasks?’
And his nephew Mohammed saw him from afar, and thought to himself, ‘My uncle is in trouble–I must go and help him;’ and the next morning he went to his master and said: ‘Dear master, I must go to my uncle, and I wish to send him here instead of myself, while I serve under his master. And that you may know it is he and no other man, I will give him my staff, and put my mantle on him.’
‘All right,’ said the master.
Mohammed set out on his journey, and in two days he arrived at the place where his uncle was standing with the old woman on his back trying to catch the birds as they flew past. And Mohammed touched him on the arm, and spoke: ‘Dear uncle, did I not warn you never to take service under any blue-eyed red-haired man!
‘But what could I do?’ asked the uncle. ‘I was hungry, and he passed, and we signed a contract.’
‘Give the contract to me!’ said the young man.
‘Here it is,’ replied the uncle, holding it out.
‘Now,’ continued Mohammed, ‘let the old woman get down from your back.’
‘Oh no, I mustn’t do that!’ cried he.
But the nephew paid no attention, and went on talking: ‘Do not worry yourself about the future. I see my way out of it all. And, first, you must take my stick and my mantle, and leave this place. After two days’ journey, straight before you, you will come to some tents which are inhabited by shepherds. Go in there, and wait.’
‘All right!’ answered the uncle.
Then Mohammed with the Magic Finger picked up a stick and struck the old woman with it, saying, ‘Get down, and look after the sheep; I want to go to sleep.’
‘Oh, certainly!’ replied she.
So Mohammed lay down comfortably under a tree and slept till evening. Towards sunset he woke up and said to the old woman: ‘Where are the singing birds which you have got to catch?’
‘You never told me anything about that,’ replied she.
‘Oh, didn’t I?’ he answered. ‘Well, it is part of your business, and if you don’t do it, I shall just kill you.’
‘Of course I will catch them!’ cried she in a hurry, and ran about the bushes after the birds, till thorns pierced her foot, and she shrieked from pain and exclaimed, ‘Oh dear, how unlucky I am! and how abominably this man is treating me!’ However, at last she managed to catch the seven birds, and brought them to Mohammed, saying, ‘Here they are!’
‘Then now we will go back to the house,’ said he.
When they had gone some way he turned to her sharply:
‘Be quick and drive the sheep home, for I do not know where their fold is.’ And she drove them before her. By-and-by the young man spoke:
‘Look here, old hag; if you say anything to your son about my having struck you, or about my not being the old shepherd, I’ll kill you!’
‘Oh, no, of course I won’t say anything!’
When they got back, the son said to his mother: ‘That is a good shepherd I’ve got, isn’t he?’
‘Oh, a splendid shepherd!’ answered she. ‘Why, look how fat the sheep are, and how much milk they give!’
‘Yes, indeed!’ replied the son, as he rose to get supper for his mother and the shepherd.
In the time of Mohammed’s uncle, the shepherd had had nothing to eat but the scraps left by the old woman; but the new shepherd was not going to be content with that.
‘You will not touch the food till I have had as much as I want,’ whispered he.
‘Very good!’ replied she. And when he had had enough, he said:
‘Now, eat!’ But she wept, and cried: ‘That was not written in your contract. You were only to have what I left!’
‘If you say a word more, I will kill you!’ said he.
The next day he took the old woman on his back, and drove the sheep in front of him till he was some distance from the house, when he let her fall, and said: ‘Quick! go and mind the sheep!’
Then he took a ram, and killed it. He lit a fire and broiled some of its flesh, and called to the old woman:
‘Come and eat with me!’ and she came. But instead of letting her eat quietly, he took a large lump of the meat and rammed it down her throat with his crook, so that she died. And when he saw she was dead, he said: ‘That is what you have got for tormenting my uncle!’ and left her lying where she was, while he went after the singing birds. It took him a long time to catch them; but at length he had the whole seven hidden in the pockets of his tunic, and then he threw the old woman’s body into some bushes, and drove the sheep before him, back to their fold. And when they drew near the house the seven boys came to meet him, and he gave a bird to each.
‘Why are you weeping?’ asked the boys, as they took their birds.
‘Because your grandmother is dead!’ And they ran and told their father. Then the man came up and said to Mohammed: ‘What was the matter? How did she die?’
And Mohammed answered: ‘I was tending the sheep when she said to me, “Kill me that ram; I am hungry!” So I killed it, and gave her the meat. But she had no teeth, and it choked her.’
‘But why did you kill the ram, instead of one of the sheep?’ asked the man.
‘What was I to do?’ said Mohammed. ‘I had to obey orders!’
‘Well, I must see to her burial!’ said the man; and the next morning Mohammed drove out the sheep as usual, thinking to himself, ‘Thank goodness I’ve got rid of the old woman! Now for the boys!’
All day long he looked after the sheep, and towards evening he began to dig some little holes in the ground, out of which he took six scorpions. These he put in his pockets, together with one bird which he caught. After this he drove his flock home.
When he approached the house the boys came out to meet him as before, saying: ‘Give me my bird!’ and he put a scorpion into the hand of each, and it stung him, and he died. But to the youngest only he gave a bird.
As soon as he saw the boys lying dead on the ground, Mohammed lifted up his voice and cried loudly: ‘Help, help! the children are dead!’
And the people came running fast, saying: ‘What has happened? How have they died?’
And Mohammed answered: ‘It was your own fault! The boys had been accustomed to birds, and in this bitter cold their fingers grew stiff, and could hold nothing, so that the birds flew away, and their spirits flew with them. Only the youngest, who managed to keep tight hold of his bird, is still alive.’
And the father groaned, and said, ‘I have borne enough! Bring no more birds, lest I lose the youngest also!’
‘All right,’ said Mohammed.
As he was driving the sheep out to grass he said to his master: ‘Out there is a splendid pasture, and I will keep the sheep there for two or, perhaps, three days, so do not be surprised at our absence.’
‘Very good!’ said the man; and Mohammed started. For two days he drove them on and on, till he reached his uncle, and said to him, ‘Dear uncle, take these sheep and look after them. I have killed the old woman and the boys, and the flock I have brought to you!’
Then Mohammed returned to his master; and on the way he took a stone and beat his own head with it till it bled, and bound his hands tight, and began to scream. The master came running and asked, ‘What is the matter?’
And Mohammed answered: ‘While the sheep were grazing, robbers came and drove them away, and because I tried to prevent them, they struck me on the head and bound my hands. See how bloody I am!’
‘What shall we do?’ said the master; ‘are the animals far off?’
‘So far that you are not likely ever to see them again,’ replied Mohammed. ‘This is the fourth day since the robbers came down. How should you be able to overtake them?’
‘Then go and herd the cows!’ said the man.
‘All right!’ replied Mohammed, and for two days he went. But on the third day he drove the cows to his uncle, first cutting off their tails. Only one cow he left behind him.
‘Take these cows, dear uncle,’ said he. ‘I am going to teach that man a lesson.’
‘Well, I suppose you know your own business best,’ said the uncle. ‘And certainly he almost worried me to death.’
So Mohammed returned to his master, carrying the cows’ tails tied up in a bundle on his back. When he came to the sea-shore, he stuck all the tails in the sand, and went and buried the one cow, whose tail he had not cut off, up to her neck, leaving the tail projecting. After he had got everything ready, he began to shriek and scream as before, till his master and all the other servants came running to see what was the matter.
‘What in the world has happened?’ they cried
‘The sea has swallowed up the cows,’ said Mohammed, ‘and nothing remains but their tails. But if you are quick and pull hard, perhaps you may get them out again!’
The master ordered each man instantly to take hold of a tail, but at the first pull they nearly tumbled backwards, and the tails were left in their hands.
‘Stop,’ cried Mohammed, ‘you are doing it all wrong. You have just pulled off their tails, and the cows have sunk to the bottom of the sea.’
‘See if you can do it any better,’ said they; and Mohammed ran to the cow which he had buried in the rough grass, and took hold of her tail and dragged the animal out at once.
‘There! that is the way to do it!’ said he, ‘I told you you knew nothing about it!’
The men slunk away, much ashamed of themselves; but the master came up to Mohammed. ‘Get you gone!’ he said, ‘there is nothing more for you to do! You have killed my mother, you have slain my children, you have stolen my sheep, you have drowned my cows; I have now no work to give you.’
‘First give me the strip of your skin which belongs to me of right, as you have broken your contract!’
‘That a judge shall decide,’ said the master; ‘we will go before him.’
‘Yes, we will,’ replied Mohammed. And they went before the judge.
‘What is your case?’ asked the judge of the master.
‘My lord,’ said the man, bowing low, ‘my shepherd here has robbed me of everything. He has killed my children and my old mother; he has stolen my sheep, he has drowned my cows in the sea.’
The shepherd answered: ‘He must pay me what he owes me, and then I will go.’
‘Yes, that is the law,’ said the judge.
‘Very well,’ returned the master, ‘let him reckon up how long he has been in my service.’
‘That won’t do,’ replied Mohammed, ‘I want my strip of skin, as we agreed in the contract.’
Seeing there was no help for it, the master cut a bit of skin, and gave it to Mohammed, who went off at once to his uncle.
‘Now we are rich, dear uncle,’ cried he; ‘we will sell our cows and sheep and go to a new country. This one is no longer the place for us.’
The sheep were soon sold, and the two comrades started on their travels. That night they reached some Bedouin tents, where they had supper with the Arabs. Before they lay down to sleep, Mohammed called the owner of the tent aside. ‘Your greyhound will eat my strip of leather,’ he said to the Arab.
‘No; do not fear.’
‘But supposing he does?’
‘Well, then, I will give him to you in exchange,’ replied the Arab.
Mohammed waited till everyone was fast asleep, then he rose softly, and tearing the bit of skin in pieces, threw it down before the greyhound, setting up wild shrieks as he did so.
‘Oh, master, said I not well that your dog would eat my thong?’
‘Be quiet, don’t make such a noise, and you shall have the dog.’
So Mohammed put a leash round his neck, and led him away.
In the evening they arrived at the tents of some more Bedouin, and asked for shelter. After supper Mohammed said to the owner of the tent, ‘Your ram will kill my greyhound.’
‘Oh, no, he won’t.’
‘And supposing he does?’
‘Then you can take him in exchange.’
So in the night Mohammed killed the greyhound, and laid his body across the horns of the ram. Then he set up shrieks and yells, till he roused the Arab, who said: ‘Take the ram and go away.’
Mohammed did not need to be told twice, and at sunset he reached another Bedouin encampment. He was received kindly, as usual, and after supper he said to his host: ‘Your daughter will kill my ram.’
‘Be silent, she will do nothing of the sort; my daughter does not need to steal meat, she has some every day.’
‘Very well, I will go to sleep; but if anything happens to my ram I will call out.’
‘If my daughter touches anything belonging to my guest I will kill her,’ said the Arab, and went to his bed.
When everybody was asleep, Mohammed got up, killed the ram, and took out his liver, which he broiled on the fire. He placed a piece of it in the girl’s hands, and laid some more on her night-dress while she slept and knew nothing about it. After this he began to cry out loudly.
‘What is the matter? be silent at once!’ called the Arab.
‘How can I be silent, when my ram, which I loved like a child, has been slain by your daughter?’
‘But my daughter is asleep,’ said the Arab.
‘Well, go and see if she has not some of the flesh about her.’
‘If she has, you may take her in exchange for the ram;’ and as they found the flesh exactly as Mohammed had foretold, the Arab gave his daughter a good beating, and then told her to get out of sight, for she was now the property of this stranger.
They wandered in the desert till, at nightfall, they came to a Bedouin encampment, where they were hospitably bidden to enter. Before lying down to sleep, Mohammed said to the owner of the tent: ‘Your mare will kill my wife.’
‘Certainly not.’
‘And if she does?’
‘Then you shall take the mare in exchange.’
When everyone was asleep, Mohammed said softly to his wife: ‘Maiden, I have got such a clever plan! I am going to bring in the mare and put it at your feet, and I will cut you, just a few little flesh wounds, so that you may be covered with blood, and everybody will suppose you to be dead. But remember that you must not make a sound, or we shall both be lost.’
This was done, and then Mohammed wept and wailed louder than ever.
The Arab hastened to the spot and cried, ‘Oh, cease making that terrible noise! Take the mare and go; but carry off the dead girl with you. She can lie quite easily across the mare’s back.’
Then Mohammed and his uncle picked up the girl, and, placing her on the mare’s back, led it away, being very careful to walk one on each side, so that she might not slip down and hurt herself. After the Arab tents could be seen no longer, the girl sat up on the saddle and looked about her, and as they were all hungry they tied up the mare, and took out some dates to eat. When they had finished, Mohammed said to his uncle: ‘Dear uncle, the maiden shall be your wife; I give her to you. But the money we got from the sheep and cows we will divide between us. You shall have two-thirds and I will have one. For you will have a wife, but I never mean to marry. And now, go in peace, for never more will you see me. The bond of bread and salt is at an end between us.’
So they wept, and fell on each other’s necks, and asked forgiveness for any wrongs in the past. Then they parted and went their ways.

Once upon a time, in a very hot country, a man lived with his wife in a little hut, which was surrounded by grass and flowers. They were perfectly happy together till, by-and-by, the woman fell ill and refused to take any food. The husband tried to persuade her to eat all sorts of delicious fruits that he had found in the forest, but she would have none of them, and grew so thin he feared she would die. ‘Is there nothing you would like?’ he said at last in despair.
‘Yes, I think I could eat some wild honey,’ answered she. The husband was overjoyed, for he thought this sounded easy enough to get, and he went off at once in search of it.
He came back with a wooden pan quite full, and gave it to his wife. ‘I can’t eat that,’ she said, turning away in disgust. ‘Look! there are some dead bees in it! I want honey that is quite pure.’ And the man threw the rejected honey on the grass, and started off to get some fresh. When he got back he offered it to his wife, who treated it as she had done the first bowlful. ‘That honey has got ants in it: throw it away,’ she said, and when he brought her some more, she declared it was full of earth. In his fourth journey he managed to find some that she would eat, and then she begged him to get her some water. This took him some time, but at length he came to a lake whose waters were sweetened with sugar. He filled a pannikin quite full, and carried it home to his wife, who drank it eagerly, and said that she now felt quite well. When she was up and had dressed herself, her husband lay down in her place, saying: ‘You have given me a great deal of trouble, and now it is my turn!’
‘What is the matter with you?’ asked the wife.
‘I am thirsty and want some water,’ answered he; and she took a large pot and carried it to the nearest spring, which was a good way off. ‘Here is the water,’ she said to her husband, lifting the heavy pot from her head; but he turned away in disgust.
‘You have drawn it from the pool that is full of frogs and willows; you must get me some more.’ So the woman set out again and walked still further to another lake.
‘This water tastes of rushes,’ he exclaimed, ‘go and get some fresh.’ But when she brought back a third supply he declared that it seemed made up of water-lilies, and that he must have water that was pure, and not spoilt by willows, or frogs, or rushes. So for the fourth time she put her jug on her head, and passing all the lakes she had hitherto tried, she came to another, where the water was golden like honey. She stooped down to drink, when a horrible head bobbed up on the surface.
‘How dare you steal my water?’ cried the head.
‘It is my husband who has sent me,’ she replied, trembling all over. ‘But do not kill me! You shall have my baby, if you will only let me go.’
‘How am I to know which is your baby?’ asked the Ogre.
‘Oh, that is easily managed. I will shave both sides of his head, and hang some white beads round his neck. And when you come to the hut you have only to call “Motikatika!” and he will run to meet you, and you can eat him.’
‘Very well,’ said the ogre, ‘you can go home.’ And after filling the pot she returned, and told her husband of the dreadful danger she had been in.
Now, though his mother did not know it, the baby was a magician and he had heard all that his mother had promised the ogre; and he laughed to himself as he planned how to outwit her.
The next morning she shaved his head on both sides, and hung the white beads round his neck, and said to him: ‘I am going to the fields to work, but you must stay at home. Be sure you do not go outside, or some wild beast may eat you.’
‘Very well,’ answered he.
As soon as his mother was out of sight, the baby took out some magic bones, and placed them in a row before him. ‘You are my father,’ he told one bone, ‘and you are my mother. You are the biggest,’ he said to the third, ‘so you shall be the ogre who wants to eat me; and you,’ to another, ‘are very little, therefore you shall be me. Now, then, tell me what I am to do.’
‘Collect all the babies in the village the same size as yourself,’ answered the bones; ‘shave the sides of their heads, and hang white beads round their necks, and tell them that when anybody calls “Motikatika,” they are to answer to it. And be quick for you have no time to lose.’
Motikatika went out directly, and brought back quite a crowd of babies, and shaved their heads and hung white beads round their little black necks, and just as he had finished, the ground began to shake, and the huge ogre came striding along, crying: ‘Motikatika! Motikatika!’
‘Here we are! here we are!’ answered the babies, all running to meet him.
‘It is Motikatika I want,’ said the ogre.
‘We are all Motikatika,’ they replied. And the ogre sat down in bewilderment, for he dared not eat the children of people who had done him no wrong, or a heavy punishment would befall him. The children waited for a little, wondering, and then they went away.
The ogre remained where he was, till the evening, when the woman returned from the fields.
‘I have not seen Motikatika,’ said he.
‘But why did you not call him by his name, as I told you?’ she asked.
‘I did, but all the babies in the village seemed to be named Motikatika,’ answered the ogre; ‘you cannot think the number who came running to me.’
The woman did not know what to make of it, so, to keep him in a good temper, she entered the hut and prepared a bowl of maize, which she brought him.
‘I do not want maize, I want the baby,’ grumbled he ‘and I will have him.’
‘Have patience,’ answered she; ‘I will call him, and you can eat him at once.’ And she went into the hut and cried, ‘Motikatika!’
‘I am coming, mother,’ replied he; but first he took out his bones, and, crouching down on the ground behind the hut, asked them how he should escape the ogre.
‘Change yourself into a mouse,’ said the bones; and so he did, and the ogre grew tired of waiting, and told the woman she must invent some other plan.
‘To-morrow I will send him into the field to pick some beans for me, and you will find him there, and can eat him.’
‘Very well,’ replied the ogre, ‘and this time I will take care to have him,’ and he went back to his lake.
Next morning Motikatika was sent out with a basket, and told to pick some beans for dinner. On the way to the field he took out his bones and asked them what he was to do to escape from the ogre. ‘Change yourself into a bird and snap off the beans,’ said the bones. And the ogre chased away the bird, not knowing that it was Motikatika.
The ogre went back to the hut and told the woman that she had deceived him again, and that he would not be put off any longer.
‘Return here this evening,’ answered she, ‘and you will find him in bed under this white coverlet. Then you can carry him away, and eat him at once.’
But the boy heard, and consulted his bones, which said: ‘Take the red coverlet from your father’s bed, and put yours on his,’ and so he did. And when the ogre came, he seized Motikatika’s father and carried him outside the hut and ate him. When his wife found out the mistake, she cried bitterly; but Motikatika said: ‘It is only just that he should be eaten, and not I; for it was he, and not I, who sent you to fetch the water.’

There was once a sultan who had three little sons, and no one seemed to be able to teach them anything; which greatly grieved both the sultan and his wife.
One day a magician came to the sultan and said, “If I take your three boys and teach them to read and write, and make great scholars of them, what will you give me?”
And the sultan said, “I will give you half of my property.”
“No,” said the magician; “that won’t do.”
“I’ll give you half of the towns I own.”
“No; that will not satisfy me.”
“What do you want, then?”
“When I have made them scholars and bring them back to you, choose two of them for yourself and give me the third; for I want to have a companion of my own.”
“Agreed,” said the sultan.
So the magician took them away, and in a remarkably short time taught them to read, and to make letters, and made them quite good scholars. Then he took them back to the sultan and said: “Here are the children. They are all equally good scholars. Choose.”
So the sultan took the two he preferred, and the magician went away with the third, whose name was Keejaa′naa, to his own house, which was a very large one.
When they arrived, Mchaa′wee, the magician, gave the youth all the keys, saying, “Open whatever you wish to.” Then he told him that he was his father, and that he was going away for a month.
When he was gone, Keejaanaa took the keys and went to examine the house. He opened one door, and saw a room full of liquid gold. He put his finger in, and the gold stuck to it, and, wipe and rub as he would, the gold would not come off; so he wrapped a piece of rag around it, and when his supposed father came home and saw the rag, and asked him what he had been doing to his finger, he was afraid to tell him the truth, so he said that he had cut it.
Not very long after, Mchaawee went away again, and the youth took the keys and continued his investigations.
The first room he opened was filled with the bones of goats, the next with sheep’s bones, the next with the bones of oxen, the fourth with the bones of donkeys, the fifth with those of horses, the sixth contained men’s skulls, and in the seventh was a live horse.
“Hullo!” said the horse; “where do you come from, you son of Adam?”
“This is my father’s house,” said Keejaanaa.
“Oh, indeed!” was the reply. “Well, you’ve got a pretty nice parent! Do you know that he occupies himself with eating people, and donkeys, and horses, and oxen and goats and everything he can lay his hands on? You and I are the only living things left.”
This scared the youth pretty badly, and he faltered, “What are we to do?”
“What’s your name?” said the horse.
“Keejaanaa.”
“Well, I’m Faaraa′see. Now, Keejaanaa, first of all, come and unfasten me.”
The youth did so at once.
“Now, then, open the door of the room with the gold in it, and I will swallow it all; then I’ll go and wait for you under the big tree down the road a little way. When the magician comes home, he will say to you, ‘Let us go for firewood;’ then you answer, ‘I don’t understand that work;’ and he will go by himself. When he comes back, he will put a great big pot on the hook and will tell you to make a fire under it. Tell him you don’t know how to make a fire, and he will make it himself.
“Then he will bring a large quantity of butter, and while it is getting hot he will put up a swing and say to you, ‘Get up there, and I’ll swing you.’ But you tell him you never played at that game, and ask him to swing first, that you may see how it is done. Then he will get up to show you; and you must push him into the big pot, and then come to me as quickly as you can.”
Then the horse went away.
Now, Mchaawee had invited some of his friends to a feast at his house that evening; so, returning home early, he said to Keejaanaa, “Let us go for firewood;” but the youth answered, “I don’t understand that work.” So he went by himself and brought the wood.
Then he hung up the big pot and said, “Light the fire;” but the youth said, “I don’t know how to do it.” So the magician laid the wood under the pot and lighted it himself.
Then he said, “Put all that butter in the pot;” but the youth answered, “I can’t lift it; I’m not strong enough.” So he put in the butter himself.
Next Mchaawee said, “Have you seen our country game?” And Keejaanaa answered, “I think not.”
“Well,” said the magician, “let’s play at it while the butter is getting hot.”
So he tied up the swing and said to Keejaanaa, “Get up here, and learn the game.” But the youth said: “You get up first and show me. I’ll learn quicker that way.”
The magician got into the swing, and just as he got started Keejaanaa gave him a push right into the big pot; and as the butter was by this time boiling, it not only killed him, but cooked him also.
As soon as the youth had pushed the magician into the big pot, he ran as fast as he could to the big tree, where the horse was waiting for him.
“Come on,” said Faaraasee; “jump on my back and let’s be going.”
So he mounted and they started off.
When the magician’s guests arrived they looked everywhere for him, but, of course, could not find him. Then, after waiting a while, they began to be very hungry; so, looking around for something to eat, they saw that the stew in the big pot was done, and, saying to each other, “Let’s begin, anyway,” they started in and ate the entire contents of the pot. After they had finished, they searched for Mchaawee again, and finding lots of provisions in the house, they thought they would stay there until he came; but after they had waited a couple of days and eaten all the food in the place, they gave him up and returned to their homes.
Meanwhile Keejaanaa and the horse continued on their way until they had gone a great distance, and at last they stopped near a large town.
“Let us stay here,” said the youth, “and build a house.”
As Faaraasee was agreeable, they did so. The horse coughed up all the gold he had swallowed, with which they purchased slaves, and cattle, and everything they needed.
When the people of the town saw the beautiful new house and all the slaves, and cattle, and riches it contained, they went and told their sultan, who at once made up his mind that the owner of such a place must be of sufficient importance to be visited and taken notice of, as an acquisition to the neighborhood.
So he called on Keejaanaa, and inquired who he was.
“Oh, I’m just an ordinary being, like other people.”
“Are you a traveler?”
“Well, I have been; but I like this place, and think I’ll settle down here.”
“Why don’t you come and walk in our town?”
“I should like to very much, but I need some one to show me around.”
“Oh, I’ll show you around,” said the sultan, eagerly, for he was quite taken with the young man.
After this Keejaanaa and the sultan became great friends; and in the course of time the young man married the sultan’s daughter, and they had one son.
They lived very happily together, and Keejaanaa loved Faaraasee as his own soul.

Sultan Maaj′noon had seven sons and a big cat, of all of whom he was very proud.
Everything went well until one day the cat went and caught a calf. When they told the sultan he said, “Well, the cat is mine, and the calf is mine.” So they said, “Oh, all right, master,” and let the matter drop.
A few days later the cat caught a goat; and when they told the sultan he said, “The cat is mine, and the goat is mine;” and so that settled it again.
Two days more passed, and the cat caught a cow. They told the sultan, and he shut them up with “My cat, and my cow.”
After another two days the cat caught a donkey; same result.
Next it caught a horse; same result.
The next victim was a camel; and when they told the sultan he said: “What’s the matter with you folks? It was my cat, and my camel. I believe you don’t like my cat, and want it killed, bringing me tales about it every day. Let it eat whatever it wants to.”
In a very short time it caught a child, and then a full-grown man; but each time the sultan remarked that both the cat and its victim were his, and thought no more of it.
Meantime the cat grew bolder, and hung around a low, open place near the town, pouncing on people going for water, or animals out at pasture, and eating them.
At last some of the people plucked up courage; and, going to the sultan, said: “How is this, master? As you are our sultan you are our protector,—or ought to be,—yet you have allowed this cat to do as it pleases, and now it lives just out of town there, and kills everything living that goes that way, while at night it comes into town and does the same thing. Now, what on earth are we to do?”
But Maajnoon only replied: “I really believe you hate my cat. I suppose you want me to kill it; but I shall do no such thing. Everything it eats is mine.”
Of course the folks were astonished at this result of the interview, and, as no one dared to kill the cat, they all had to remove from the vicinity where it lived. But this did not mend matters, because, when it found no one came that way, it shifted its quarters likewise.
So complaints continued to pour in, until at last Sultan Maajnoon gave orders that if any one came to make accusations against the cat, he was to be informed that the master could not be seen.
When things got so that people neither let their animals out nor went out themselves, the cat went farther into the country, killing and eating cattle, and fowls, and everything that came its way.
One day the sultan said to six of his sons, “I’m going to look at the country to-day; come along with me.”
The seventh son was considered too young to go around anywhere, and was always left at home with the women folk, being called by his brothers Mkaa′ah Jeecho′nee, which means Mr. Sit-in-the-kitchen.
Well, they went, and presently came to a thicket. The father was in front and the six sons following him, when the cat jumped out and killed three of the latter.
The attendants shouted, “The cat! the cat!” and the soldiers asked permission to search for and kill it, which the sultan readily granted, saying: “This is not a cat, it is a noon′dah. It has taken from me my own sons.”
Now, nobody had ever seen a noondah, but they all knew it was a terrible beast that could kill and eat all other living things.
When the sultan began to bemoan the loss of his sons, some of those who heard him said: “Ah, master, this noondah does not select his prey. He doesn’t say: ‘This is my master’s son, I’ll leave him alone,’ or, ‘This is my master’s wife, I won’t eat her.’ When we told you what the cat had done, you always said it was your cat, and what it ate was yours, and now it has killed your sons, and we don’t believe it would hesitate to eat even you.”
And he said, “I fear you are right.”
As for the soldiers who tried to get the cat, some were killed and the remainder ran away, and the sultan and his living sons took the dead bodies home and buried them.
Now when Mkaaah Jeechonee, the seventh son, heard that his brothers had been killed by the noondah, he said to his mother, “I, too, will go, that it may kill me as well as my brothers, or I will kill it.”
But his mother said: “My son, I do not like to have you go. Those three are already dead; and if you are killed also, will not that be one wound upon another to my heart?”
“Nevertheless,” said he, “I can not help going; but do not tell my father.”
So his mother made him some cakes, and sent some attendants with him; and he took a great spear, as sharp as a razor, and a sword, bade her farewell, and departed.
As he had always been left at home, he had no very clear idea what he was going to hunt for; so he had not gone far beyond the suburbs, when, seeing a very large dog, he concluded that this was the animal he was after; so he killed it, tied a rope to it, and dragged it home, singing,
“Oh, mother, I have killed
The noondah, eater of the people.”
When his mother, who was upstairs, heard him, she looked out of the window, and, seeing what he had brought, said, “My son, this is not the noondah, eater of the people.”
So he left the carcass outside and went in to talk about it, and his mother said, “My dear boy, the noondah is a much larger animal than that; but if I were you, I’d give the business up and stay at home.”
“No, indeed,” he exclaimed; “no staying at home for me until I have met and fought the noondah.”
So he set out again, and went a great deal farther than he had gone on the former day. Presently he saw a civet cat, and, believing it to be the animal he was in search of, he killed it, bound it, and dragged it home, singing,
“Oh, mother, I have killed
The noondah, eater of the people.”
When his mother saw the civet cat, she said, “My son, this is not the noondah, eater of the people.” And he threw it away.
Again his mother entreated him to stay at home, but he would not listen to her, and started off again.
This time he went away off into the forest, and seeing a bigger cat than the last one, he killed it, bound it, and dragged it home, singing,
“Oh, mother, I have killed
The noondah, eater of the people.”
But directly his mother saw it, she had to tell him, as before, “My son, this is not the noondah, eater of the people.”
He was, of course, very much troubled at this; and his mother said, “Now, where do you expect to find this noondah? You don’t know where it is, and you don’t know what it looks like. You’ll get sick over this; you’re not looking so well now as you did. Come, stay at home.”
But he said: “There are three things, one of which I shall do: I shall die; I shall find the noondah and kill it; or I shall return home unsuccessful. In any case, I’m off again.”
This time he went farther than before, saw a zebra, killed it, bound it, and dragged it home, singing,
“Oh, mother, I have killed
The noondah, eater of the people.”
Of course his mother had to tell him, once again, “My son, this is not the noondah, eater of the people.”
After a good deal of argument, in which his mother’s persuasion, as usual, was of no avail, he went off again, going farther than ever, when he caught a giraffe; and when he had killed it he said: “Well, this time I’ve been successful. This must be the noondah.” So he dragged it home, singing,
“Oh, mother, I have killed
The noondah, eater of the people.”
Again his mother had to assure him, “My son, this is not the noondah, eater of the people.” She then pointed out to him that his brothers were not running about hunting for the noondah, but staying at home attending to their own business. But, remarking that all brothers were not alike, he expressed his determination to stick to his task until it came to a successful termination, and went off again, a still greater distance than before.
While going through the wilderness he espied a rhinoceros asleep under a tree, and turning to his attendants he exclaimed, “At last I see the noondah.”
“Where, master?” they all cried, eagerly.
“There, under the tree.”
“Oh-h! What shall we do?” they asked.
And he answered: “First of all, let us eat our fill, then we will attack it. We have found it in a good place, though if it kills us, we can’t help it.”
So they all took out their arrowroot cakes and ate till they were satisfied.
Then Mkaaah Jeechonee said, “Each of you take two guns; lay one beside you and take the other in your hands, and at the proper time let us all fire at once.”
And they said, “All right, master.”
So they crept cautiously through the bushes and got around to the other side of the tree, at the back of the rhinoceros; then they closed up till they were quite near it, and all fired together. The beast jumped up, ran a little way, and then fell down dead.
They bound it, and dragged it for two whole days, until they reached the town, when Mkaaah Jeechonee began singing,
“Oh, mother, I have killed
The noondah, eater of the people.”
But he received the same answer from his mother: “My son, this is not the noondah, eater of the people.”
And many persons came and looked at the rhinoceros, and felt very sorry for the young man. As for his father and mother, they both begged of him to give up, his father offering to give him anything he possessed if he would only stay at home. But he said, “I don’t hear what you are saying; good-bye,” and was off again.
This time he still further increased the distance from his home, and at last he saw an elephant asleep at noon in the forest. Thereupon he said to his attendants, “Now we have found the noondah.”
“Ah, where is he?” said they.
“Yonder, in the shade. Do you see it?”
“Oh, yes, master; shall we march up to it?”
“If we march up to it, and it is looking this way, it will come at us, and if it does that, some of us will be killed. I think we had best let one man steal up close and see which way its face is turned.”
As every one thought this was a good idea, a slave named Keerobo′to crept on his hands and knees, and had a good look at it. When he returned in the same manner, his master asked: “Well, what’s the news? Is it the noondah?”
“I do not know,” replied Keeroboto; “but I think there is very little doubt that it is. It is broad, with a very big head, and, goodness, I never saw such large ears!”
“All right,” said Mkaaah Jeechonee; “let us eat, and then go for it.”
So they took their arrowroot cakes, and their molasses cakes, and ate until they were quite full.
Then the youth said to them: “My people, to-day is perhaps the last we shall ever see; so we will take leave of each other. Those who are to escape will escape, and those who are to die will die; but if I die, let those who escape tell my mother and father not to grieve for me.”
But his attendants said, “Oh, come along, master; none of us will die, please God.”
So they went on their hands and knees till they were close up, and then they said to Mkaaah Jeechonee, “Give us your plan, master;” but he said, “There is no plan, only let all fire at once.”
Well, they fired all at once, and immediately the elephant jumped up and charged at them. Then such a helter-skelter flight as there was! They threw away their guns and everything they carried, and made for the trees, which they climbed with surprising alacrity.
As to the elephant, he kept straight ahead until he fell down some distance away.
They all remained in the trees from three until six o’clock in the morning, without food and without clothing.
The young man sat in his tree and wept bitterly, saying, “I don’t exactly know what death is, but it seems to me this must be very like it.” As no one could see any one else, he did not know where his attendants were, and though he wished to come down from the tree, he thought, “Maybe the noondah is down below there, and will eat me.”
Each attendant was in exactly the same fix, wishing to come down, but afraid the noondah was waiting to eat him.
Keeroboto had seen the elephant fall, but was afraid to get down by himself, saying, “Perhaps, though it has fallen down, it is not dead.” But presently he saw a dog go up to it and smell it, and then he was sure it was dead. Then he got down from the tree as fast as he could and gave a signal cry, which was answered; but not being sure from whence the answer came, he repeated the cry, listening intently. When it was answered he went straight to the place from which the sound proceeded, and found two of his companions in one tree. To them he said, “Come on; get down; the noondah is dead.” So they got down quickly and hunted around until they found their master. When they told him the news, he came down also; and after a little the attendants had all gathered together and had picked up their guns and their clothes, and were all right again. But they were all weak and hungry, so they rested and ate some food, after which they went to examine their prize.
As soon as Mkaaah Jeechonee saw it he said, “Ah, this is the noondah! This is it! This is it!” And they all agreed that it was it.
So they dragged the elephant three days to their town, and then the youth began singing,
“Oh, mother, this is he,
The noondah, eater of the people.”
He was, naturally, quite upset when his mother replied, “My son, this is not the noondah, eater of the people.” She further said: “Poor boy! what trouble you have been through. All the people are astonished that one so young should have such a great understanding!”
Then his father and mother began their entreaties again, and finally it was agreed that this next trip should be his last, whatever the result might be.
Well, they started off again, and went on and on, past the forest, until they came to a very high mountain, at the foot of which they camped for the night.
In the morning they cooked their rice and ate it, and then Mkaaah Jeechonee said: “Let us now climb the mountain, and look all over the country from its peak.” And they went and they went, until after a long, weary while, they reached the top, where they sat down to rest and form their plans.
Now, one of the attendants, named Shindaa′no, while walking about, cast his eyes down the side of the mountain, and suddenly saw a great beast about half way down; but he could not make out its appearance distinctly, on account of the distance and the trees. Calling his master, he pointed it out to him, and something in Mkaaah Jeechonee’s heart told him that it was the noondah. To make sure, however, he took his gun and his spear and went partly down the mountain to get a better view.
“Ah,” said he, “this must be the noondah. My mother told me its ears were small, and those are small; she told me the noondah is broad and short, and so is this; she said it has two blotches, like a civet cat, and there are the blotches; she told me the tail is thick, and there is a thick tail. It must be the noondah.”
Then he went back to his attendants and bade them eat heartily, which they did. Next he told them to leave every unnecessary thing behind, because if they had to run they would be better without encumbrance, and if they were victorious they could return for their goods.
When they had made all their arrangements they started down the mountain, but when they had got about half way down Keeroboto and Shindaano were afraid. Then the youth said to them: “Oh, let’s go on; don’t be afraid. We all have to live and die. What are you frightened about?” So, thus encouraged, they went on.
When they came near the place, Mkaaah Jeechonee ordered them to take off all their clothing except one piece, and to place that tightly on their bodies, so that if they had to run they would not be caught by thorns or branches.
So when they came close to the beast, they saw that it was asleep, and all agreed that it was the noondah.
Then the young man said, “Now the sun is setting, shall we fire at it, or let be till morning?”
And they all wished to fire at once, and see what the result would be without further tax on their nerves; therefore they arranged that they should all fire together.
They all crept up close, and when the master gave the word, they discharged their guns together. The noondah did not move; that one dose had been sufficient. Nevertheless, they all turned and scampered up to the top of the mountain. There they ate and rested for the night.
In the morning they ate their rice, and then went down to see how matters were, when they found the beast lying dead.
After resting and eating, they started homeward, dragging the dead beast with them. On the fourth day it began to give indications of decay, and the attendants wished to abandon it; but Mkaaah Jeechonee said they would continue to drag it if there was only one bone left.
When they came near the town he began to sing,
“Mother, mother, I have come
From the evil spirits, home.
Mother, listen while I sing;
While I tell you what I bring.
Oh, mother, I have killed
The noondah, eater of the people.”
And when his mother looked out, she cried, “My son, this is the noondah, eater of the people.”
Then all the people came out to welcome him, and his father was overcome with joy, and loaded him with honors, and procured him a rich and beautiful wife; and when he died Mkaaah Jeechonee became sultan, and lived long and happily, beloved by all the people.

Once upon a time there lived a sultan who loved his garden dearly, and planted it with trees and flowers and fruits from all parts of the world. He went to see them three times every day: first at seven o’clock, when he got up, then at three, and lastly at half-past five. There was no plant and no vegetable which escaped his eye, but he lingered longest of all before his one date tree.
Now the sultan had seven sons. Six of them he was proud of, for they were strong and manly, but the youngest he disliked, for he spent all his time among the women of the house. The sultan had talked to him, and he paid no heed; and he had beaten him, and he paid no heed; and he had tied him up, and he paid no heed, till at last his father grew tired of trying to make him change his ways, and let him alone.
Time passed, and one day the sultan, to his great joy, saw signs of fruit on his date tree. And he told his vizir, ‘My date tree is bearing;’ and he told the officers, ‘My date tree is bearing;’ and he told the judges, ‘My date tree is bearing;’ and he told all the rich men of the town.
He waited patiently for some days till the dates were nearly ripe, and then he called his six sons, and said: ‘One of you must watch the date tree till the dates are ripe, for if it is not watched the slaves will steal them, and I shall not have any for another year.’
And the eldest son answered, ‘I will go, father,’ and he went.
The first thing the youth did was to summon his slaves, and bid them beat drums all night under the date tree, for he feared to fall asleep. So the slaves beat the drums, and the young man danced till four o’clock, and then it grew so cold he could dance no longer, and one of the slaves said to him: ‘It is getting light; the tree is safe; lie down, master, and go to sleep.’
So he lay down and slept, and his slaves slept likewise.
A few minutes went by, and a bird flew down from a neighbouring thicket, and ate all the dates, without leaving a single one. And when the tree was stripped bare, the bird went as it had come. Soon after, one of the slaves woke up and looked for the dates, but there were no dates to see. Then he ran to the young man and shook him, saying:
‘Your father set you to watch the tree, and you have not watched, and the dates have all been eaten by a bird.’
The lad jumped up and ran to the tree to see for himself, but there was not a date anywhere. And he cried aloud, ‘What am I to say to my father? Shall I tell him that the dates have been stolen, or that a great rain fell and a great storm blew? But he will send me to gather them up and bring them to him, and there are none to bring! Shall I tell him that Bedouins drove me away, and when I returned there were no dates? And he will answer, “You had slaves, did they not fight with the Bedouins?” It is the truth that will be best, and that will I tell him.’
Then he went straight to his father, and found him sitting in his verandah with his five sons round him; and the lad bowed his head.
‘Give me the news from the garden,’ said the sultan.
And the youth answered, ‘The dates have all been eaten by some bird: there is not one left.’
The sultan was silent for a moment: then he asked, ‘Where were you when the bird came?’
The lad answered: ‘I watched the date tree till the cocks were crowing and it was getting light; then I lay down for a little, and I slept. When I woke a slave was standing over me, and he said, “There is not one date left on the tree!” And I went to the date tree, and saw it was true; and that is what I have to tell you.’
And the sultan replied, ‘A son like you is only good for eating and sleeping. I have no use for you. Go your way, and when my date tree bears again, I will send another son; perhaps he will watch better.’
So he waited many months, till the tree was covered with more dates than any tree had ever borne before. When they were near ripening he sent one of his sons to the garden: saying, ‘My son, I am longing to taste those dates: go and watch over them, for to-day’s sun will bring them to perfection.’
And the lad answered: ‘My father, I am going now, and to-morrow, when the sun has passed the hour of seven, bid a slave come and gather the dates.’
‘Good,’ said the sultan.
The youth went to the tree, and lay down and slept. And about midnight he arose to look at the tree, and the dates were all there–beautiful dates, swinging in bunches.
‘Ah, my father will have a feast, indeed,’ thought he. ‘What a fool my brother was not to take more heed! Now he is in disgrace, and we know him no more. Well, I will watch till the bird comes. I should like to see what manner of bird it is.’
And he sat and read till the cocks crew and it grew light, and the dates were still on the tree.
‘Oh my father will have his dates; they are all safe now,’ he thought to himself. ‘I will make myself comfortable against this tree,’ and he leaned against the trunk, and sleep came on him, and the bird flew down and ate all the dates.
When the sun rose, the head-man came and looked for the dates, and there were no dates. And he woke the young man, and said to him, ‘Look at the tree.’
And the young man looked, and there were no dates. And his ears were stopped, and his legs trembled, and his tongue grew heavy at the thought of the sultan. His slave became frightened as he looked at him, and asked, ‘My master, what is it?’
He answered, ‘I have no pain anywhere, but I am ill everywhere. My whole body is well, and my whole body is sick I fear my father, for did I not say to him, “To-morrow at seven you shall taste the dates”? And he will drive me away, as he drove away my brother! I will go away myself, before he sends me.’
Then he got up and took a road that led straight past the palace, but he had not walked many steps before he met a man carrying a large silver dish, covered with a white cloth to cover the dates.
And the young man said, ‘The dates are not ripe yet; you must return to-morrow.’
And the slave went with him to the palace, where the sultan was sitting with his four sons.
‘Good greeting, master!’ said the youth.
And the sultan answered, ‘Have you seen the man I sent?’
‘I have, master; but the dates are not yet ripe.’
But the sultan did not believe his words, and said; ‘This second year I have eaten no dates, because of my sons. Go your ways, you are my son no longer!’
And the sultan looked at the four sons that were left him, and promised rich gifts to whichever of them would bring him the dates from the tree. But year by year passed, and he never got them. One son tried to keep himself awake with playing cards; another mounted a horse and rode round and round the tree, while the two others, whom their father as a last hope sent together, lit bonfires. But whatever they did, the result was always the same. Towards dawn they fell asleep, and the bird ate the dates on the tree.
The sixth year had come, and the dates on the tree were thicker than ever. And the head-man went to the palace and told the sultan what he had seen. But the sultan only shook his head, and said sadly, ‘What is that to me? I have had seven sons, yet for five years a bird has devoured my dates; and this year it will be the same as ever.’
Now the youngest son was sitting in the kitchen, as was his custom, when he heard his father say those words. And he rose up, and went to his father, and knelt before him. ‘Father, this year you shall eat dates,’ cried he. ‘And on the tree are five great bunches, and each bunch I will give to a separate nation, for the nations in the town are five. This time, I will watch the date tree myself.’ But his father and his mother laughed heartily, and thought his words idle talk.
One day, news was brought to the sultan that the dates were ripe, and he ordered one of his men to go and watch the tree. His son, who happened to be standing by, heard the order, and he said:
‘How is it that you have bidden a man to watch the tree, when I, your son, am left?’
And his father answered, ‘Ah, six were of no use, and where they failed, will you succeed?’
But the boy replied: ‘Have patience to-day, and let me go, and to-morrow you shall see whether I bring you dates or not.’
‘Let the child go, Master,’ said his wife; ‘perhaps we shall eat the dates–or perhaps we shall not–but let him go.’
And the sultan answered: ‘I do not refuse to let him go, but my heart distrusts him. His brothers all promised fair, and what did they do?’
But the boy entreated, saying, ‘Father, if you and I and mother be alive to-morrow, you shall eat the dates.’
‘Go then,’ said his father.
When the boy reached the garden, he told the slaves to leave him, and to return home themselves and sleep. When he was alone, he laid himself down and slept fast till one o’clock, when he arose, and sat opposite the date tree. Then he took some Indian corn out of one fold of his dress, and some sandy grit out of another.
And he chewed the corn till he felt he was growing sleepy, and then he put some grit into his mouth, and that kept him awake till the bird came.
“Then the boy stole softly up, and caught it by the wing.” Illustration by H.J. Ford, published in The Violet Fairy Book (1906), Longmans, Green & Co.
It looked about at first without seeing him, and whispering to itself, ‘There is no one here,’ fluttered lightly on to the tree and stretched out his beak for the dates. Then the boy stole softly up, and caught it by the wing.
The bird turned and flew quickly away, but the boy never let go, not even when they soared high into the air.
‘Son of Adam,’ the bird said when the tops of the mountains looked small below them, ‘if you fall, you will be dead long before you reach the ground, so go your way, and let me go mine.’
But the boy answered, ‘Wherever you go, I will go with you. You cannot get rid of me.’
‘I did not eat your dates,’ persisted the bird, ‘and the day is dawning. Leave me to go my way.’
But again the boy answered him: ‘My six brothers are hateful to my father because you came and stole the dates, and to-day my father shall see you, and my brothers shall see you, and all the people of the town, great and small, shall see you. And my father’s heart will rejoice.’
‘Well, if you will not leave me, I will throw you off,’ said the bird.
So it flew up higher still–so high that the earth shone like one of the other stars.
‘How much of you will be left if you fall from here?’ asked the bird.
‘If I die, I die,’ said the boy, ‘but I will not leave you.’
And the bird saw it was no use talking, and went down to the earth again.
‘Here you are at home, so let me go my way,’ it begged once more; ‘or at least make a covenant with me.’
‘What covenant?’ said the boy.
‘Save me from the sun,’ replied the bird, ‘and I will save you from rain.’
‘How can you do that, and how can I tell if I can trust you?’
‘Pull a feather from my tail, and put it in the fire, and if you want me I will come to you, wherever I am.’
And the boy answered, ‘Well, I agree; go your way.’
‘Farewell, my friend. When you call me, if it is from the depths of the sea, I will come.’
The lad watched the bird out of sight; then he went straight to the date tree. And when he saw the dates his heart was glad, and his body felt stronger and his eyes brighter than before. And he laughed out loud with joy, and said to himself, ‘This is MY luck, mine, Sit-in-the-kitchen! Farewell, date tree, I am going to lie down. What ate you will eat you no more.’
The sun was high in the sky before the head-man, whose business it was, came to look at the date tree, expecting to find it stripped of all its fruit, but when he saw the dates so thick that they almost hid the leaves he ran back to his house, and beat a big drum till everybody came running, and even the little children wanted to know what had happened.
‘What is it? What is it, head-man?’ cried they.
‘Ah, it is not a son that the master has, but a lion! This day Sit-in-the-kitchen has uncovered his face before his father!’
‘But how, head-man?’
‘To day the people may eat the dates.’
‘Is it true, head-man?’
‘Oh yes, it is true, but let him sleep till each man has brought forth a present. He who has fowls, let him take fowls; he who has a goat, let him take a goat; he who has rice, let him take rice.’ And the people did as he had said.
Then they took the drum, and went to the tree where the boy lay sleeping.
And they picked him up, and carried him away, with horns and clarionets and drums, with clappings of hands and shrieks of joy, straight to his father’s house.
When his father heard the noise and saw the baskets made of green leaves, brimming over with dates, and his son borne high on the necks of slaves, his heart leaped, and he said to himself ‘To-day at last I shall eat dates.’ And he called his wife to see what her son had done, and ordered his soldiers to take the boy and bring him to his father.
‘What news, my son?’ said he.
‘News? I have no news, except that if you will open your mouth you shall see what dates taste like.’ And he plucked a date, and put it into his father’s mouth.
‘Ah! You are indeed my son,’ cried the sultan. ‘You do not take after those fools, those good-for-nothings. But, tell me, what did you do with the bird, for it was you, and you only who watched for it?’
‘Yes, it was I who watched for it and who saw it. And it will not come again, neither for its life, nor for your life, nor for the lives of your children.’
‘Oh, once I had six sons, and now I have only one. It is you, whom I called a fool, who have given me the dates: as for the others, I want none of them.’
But his wife rose up and went to him, and said, ‘Master, do not, I pray you, reject them,’ and she entreated long, till the sultan granted her prayer, for she loved the six elder ones more than her last one.
So they all lived quietly at home, till the sultan’s cat went and caught a calf. And the owner of the calf went and told the sultan, but he answered, ‘The cat is mine, and the calf mine,’ and the man dared not complain further.
Two days after, the cat caught a cow, and the sultan was told, ‘Master, the cat has caught a cow,’ but he only said, ‘It was my cow and my cat.’
And the cat waited a few days, and then it caught a donkey, and they told the sultan, ‘Master, the cat has caught a donkey,’ and he said, ‘My cat and my donkey.’ Next it was a horse, and after that a camel, and when the sultan was told he said, ‘You don’t like this cat, and want me to kill it. And I shall not kill it. Let it eat the camel: let it even eat a man.’
And it waited till the next day, and caught some one’s child. And the sultan was told, ‘The cat has caught a child.’ And he said, ‘The cat is mine and the child mine.’ Then it caught a grown-up man.
After that the cat left the town and took up its abode in a thicket near the road. So if any one passed, going for water, it devoured him. If it saw a cow going to feed, it devoured him. If it saw a goat, it devoured him. Whatever went along that road the cat caught and ate.
Then the people went to the sultan in a body, and told him of all the misdeeds of that cat. But he answered as before, ‘The cat is mine and the people are mine.’ And no man dared kill the cat, which grew bolder and bolder, and at last came into the town to look for its prey.
One day, the sultan said to his six sons, ‘I am going into the country, to see how the wheat is growing, and you shall come with me.’ They went on merrily along the road, till they came to a thicket, when out sprang the cat, and killed three of the sons.
‘The cat! The cat!’ shrieked the soldiers who were with him. And this time the sultan said:
‘Seek for it and kill it. It is no longer a cat, but a demon!’
And the soldiers answered him, ‘Did we not tell you, master, what the cat was doing, and did you not say, “My cat and my people”?’
And he answered: ‘True, I said it.’
Now the youngest son had not gone with the rest, but had stayed at home with his mother; and when he heard that his brothers had been killed by the cat he said, ‘Let me go, that it may slay me also.’ His mother entreated him not to leave her, but he would not listen, and he took his sword and a spear and some rice cakes, and went after the cat, which by this time had run of to a great distance.
The lad spent many days hunting the cat, which now bore the name of ‘The Nunda, eater of people,’ but though he killed many wild animals he saw no trace of the enemy he was hunting for. There was no beast, however fierce, that he was afraid of, till at last his father and mother begged him to give up the chase after the Nunda.
But he answered: ‘What I have said, I cannot take back. If I am to die, then I die, but every day I must go and seek for the Nunda.’
And again his father offered him what he would, even the crown itself, but the boy would hear nothing, and went on his way.
Many times his slaves came and told him, ‘We have seen footprints, and to-day we shall behold the Nunda.’ But the footprints never turned out to be those of the Nunda. They wandered far through deserts and through forests, and at length came to the foot of a great hill. And something in the boy’s soul whispered that here was the end of all their seeking, and to-day they would find the Nunda.
But before they began to climb the mountain the boy ordered his slaves to cook some rice, and they rubbed the stick to make a fire, and when the fire was kindled they cooked the rice and ate it. Then they began their climb.
Suddenly, when they had almost reached the top, a slave who was on in front cried:
‘Master! Master!’ And the boy pushed on to where the slave stood, and the slave said:
‘Cast your eyes down to the foot of the mountain.’ And the boy looked, and his soul told him it was the Nunda.
And he crept down with his spear in his hand, and then he stopped and gazed below him.
‘This MUST be the real Nunda,’ thought he. ‘My mother told me its ears were small, and this one’s are small. She told me it was broad and not long, and this is broad and not long. She told me it had spots like a civet-cat, and this has spots like a civet-cat.’
Then he left the Nunda lying asleep at the foot of the mountain, and went back to his slaves.
‘We will feast to-day,’ he said; ‘make cakes of batter, and bring water,’ and they ate and drank. And when they had finished he bade them hide the rest of the food in the thicket, that if they slew the Nunda they might return and eat and sleep before going back to the town. And the slaves did as he bade them.
It was now afternoon, and the lad said: ‘It is time we went after the Nunda.’ And they went till they reached the bottom and came to a great forest which lay between them and the Nunda.
Here the lad stopped, and ordered every slave that wore two cloths to cast one away and tuck up the other between his legs. ‘For,’ said he, ‘the wood is not a little one. Perhaps we may be caught by the thorns, or perhaps we may have to run before the Nunda, and the cloth might bind our legs, and cause us to fall before it.’
And they answered, ‘Good, master,’ and did as he bade them. Then they crawled on their hands and knees to where the Nunda lay asleep.
Noiselessly they crept along till they were quite close to it; then, at a sign from the boy, they threw their spears. The Nunda did not stir: the spears had done their work, but a great fear seized them all, and they ran away and climbed the mountain.
The sun was setting when they reached the top, and glad they were to take out the fruit and the cakes and the water which they had hidden away, and sit down and rest themselves. And after they had eaten and were filled, they lay down and slept till morning.
When the dawn broke they rose up and cooked more rice, and drank more water. After that they walked all round the back of the mountain to the place where they had left the Nunda, and they saw it stretched out where they had found it, stiff and dead. And they took it up and carried it back to the town, singing as they went, ‘He has killed the Nunda, the eater of people.’
And when his father heard the news, and that his son was come, and was bringing the Nunda with him, he felt that the man did not dwell on the earth whose joy was greater than his. And the people bowed down to the boy and gave him presents, and loved him, because he had delivered them from the bondage of fear, and had slain the Nunda.

An old couple once lived in a hut under a grove of palm trees, and they had one son and one daughter. They were all very happy together for many years, and then the father became very ill, and felt he was going to die. He called his children to the place where he lay on the floor–for no one had any beds in that country– and said to his son, ‘I have no herds of cattle to leave you–only the few things there are in the house–for I am a poor man, as you know. But choose: will you have my blessing or my property?’
‘Your property, certainly,’ answered the son, and his father nodded.
‘And you?’ asked the old man of the girl, who stood by her brother.
‘I will have blessing,’ she answered, and her father gave her much blessing.
That night he died, and his wife and son and daughter mourned for him seven days, and gave him a burial according to the custom of his people. But hardly was the time of mourning over, than the mother was attacked by a disease which was common in that country.
‘I am going away from you,’ she said to her children, in a faint voice; ‘but first, my son, choose which you will have: blessing or property.’
‘Property, certainly,’ answered the son.
‘And you, my daughter?’
‘I will have blessing,’ said the girl; and her mother gave her much blessing, and that night she died.
When the days of mourning were ended, the brother bade his sister put outside the hut all that belonged to his father and his mother. So the girl put them out, and he took them away, save only a small pot and a vessel in which she could clean her corn. But she had no corn to clean.
She sat at home, sad and hungry, when a neighbour knocked at the door.
‘My pot has cracked in the fire, lend me yours to cook my supper in, and I will give you a handful of corn in return.’
And the girl was glad, and that night she was able to have supper herself, and next day another woman borrowed her pot, and then another and another, for never were known so many accidents as befell the village pots at that time. She soon grew quite fat with all the corn she earned with the help of her pot, and then one evening she picked up a pumpkin seed in a corner, and planted it near her well, and it sprang up, and gave her many pumpkins.
At last it happened that a youth from her village passed through the place where the girl’s brother was, and the two met and talked.
‘What news is there of my sister?’ asked the young man, with whom things had gone badly, for he was idle.
‘She is fat and well-liking,’ replied the youth, ‘for the women borrow her mortar to clean their corn, and borrow her pot to cook it in, and for al this they give her more food than she can eat.’ And he went his way.
Now the brother was filled with envy at the words of the man, and he set out at once, and before dawn he had reached the hut, and saw the pot and the mortar were standing outside. He slung them over his shoulders and departed, pleased with his own cleverness; but when his sister awoke and sought for the pot to cook her corn for breakfast, she could find it nowhere. At length she said to herself,
‘Well, some thief must have stolen them while I slept. I will go and see if any of my pumpkins are ripe.’ And indeed they were, and so many that the tree was almost broken by the weight of them. So she ate what she wanted and took the others to the village, and gave them in exchange for corn, and the women said that no pumpkins were as sweet as these, and that she was to bring every day all that she had. In this way she earned more than she needed for herself, and soon was able to get another mortar and cooking pot in exchange for her corn. Then she thought she was quite rich.
Unluckily someone else thought so too, and this was her brother’s wife, who had heard all about the pumpkin tree, and sent her slave with a handful of grain to buy her a pumpkin. At first the girl told him that so few were left that she could not spare any; but when she found that he belonged to her brother, she changed her mind, and went out to the tree and gathered the largest and the ripest that was there.
‘Take this one,’ she said to the slave, ‘and carry it back to your mistress, but tell her to keep the corn, as the pumpkin is a gift.’
The brother’s wife was overjoyed at the sight of the fruit, and when she tasted it, she declared it was the nicest she had ever eaten. Indeed, all night she thought of nothing else, and early in the morning she called another slave (for she was a rich woman) and bade him go and ask for another pumpkin. But the girl, who had just been out to look at her tree, told him that they were all eaten, so he went back empty-handed to his mistress.
In the evening her husband returned from hunting a long way off, and found his wife in tears.
‘What is the matter?’ asked he.
‘I sent a slave with some grain to your sister to buy some pumpkins, but she would not sell me any, and told me there were none, though I know she lets other people buy them.’
‘Well, never mind now–go to sleep,’ said he, ‘and to-morrow I will go and pull up the pumpkin tree, and that will punish her for treating you so badly.’
So before sunrise he got up and set out for his sister’s house, and found her cleaning some corn.
‘Why did you refuse to sell my wife a pumpkin yesterday when she wanted one?’ he asked.
‘The old ones are finished, and the new ones are not yet come,’ answered the girl. ‘When her slave arrived two days ago, there were only four left; but I gave him one, and would take no corn for it.’
‘I do not believe you; you have sold them all to other people. I shall go and cut down the pumpkin,’ cried her brother in a rage.
‘If you cut down the pumpkin you shall cut off my hand with it,’ exclaimed the girl, running up to her tree and catching hold of it. But her brother followed, and with one blow cut off the pumpkin and her hand too.
Then he went into the house and took away everything he could find, and sold the house to a friend of his who had long wished to have it, and his sister had no home to go to.
Meanwhile she had bathed her arm carefully, and bound on it some healing leaves that grew near by, and wrapped a cloth round the leaves, and went to hide in the forest, that her brother might not find her again.
For seven days she wandered about, eating only the fruit that hung from the trees above her, and every night she climbed up and tucked herself safely among the creepers which bound together the big branches, so that neither lions nor tigers nor panthers might get at her.
When she woke up on the seventh morning she saw from her perch smoke coming up from a little town on the edge of the forest. The sight of the huts made her feel more lonely and helpless than before. She longed desperately for a draught of milk from a gourd, for there were no streams in that part, and she was very thirsty, but how was she to earn anything with only one hand? And at this thought her courage failed, and she began to cry bitterly.
It happened that the king’s son had come out from the town very early to shoot birds, and when the sun grew hot he left tired.
‘I will lie here and rest under this tree,’ he said to his attendants. ‘You can go and shoot instead, and I will just have this slave to stay with me!’ Away they went, and the young man fell asleep, and slept long. Suddenly he was awakened by something wet and salt falling on his face.
‘What is that? Is it raining?’ he said to his slave. ‘Go and look.’
‘No, master, it is not raining,’ answered the slave.
‘Then climb up the tree and see what it is,’ and the slave climbed up, and came back and told his master that a beautiful girl was sitting up there, and that it must have been her tears which had fallen on the face of the king’s son.
‘Why was she crying?’ inquired the prince.
‘I cannot tell–I did not dare to ask her; but perhaps she would tell you.’ And the master, greatly wondering, climbed up the tree.
‘What is the matter with you?’ said he gently, and, as she only sobbed louder, he continued:
‘Are you a woman, or a spirit of the woods?’
‘I am a woman,’ she answered slowly, wiping her eyes with a leaf of the creeper that hung about her.
‘Then why do you cry?’ he persisted.
‘I have many things to cry for,’ she replied, ‘more than you could ever guess.’
‘Come home with me,’ said the prince; ‘it is not very far. Come home to my father and mother. I am a king’s son.’
‘Then why are you here?’ she said, opening her eyes and staring at him.
‘Once every month I and my friends shoot birds in the forest,’ he answered, ‘but I was tired and bade them leave me to rest. And you–what are you doing up in this tree?’
At that she began to cry again, and told the king’s son all that had befallen her since the death of her mother.
‘I cannot come down with you, for I do not like anyone to see me,’ she ended with a sob.
‘Oh! I will manage all that,’ said the king’s son, and swinging himself to a lower branch, he bade his slave go quickly into the town, and bring back with him four strong men and a curtained litter. When the man was gone, the girl climbed down, and hid herself on the ground in some bushes. Very soon the slave returned with the litter, which was placed on the ground close to the bushes where the girl lay.
‘Now go, all of you, and call my attendants, for I do not wish to say here any longer,’ he said to the men, and as soon as they were out of sight he bade the girl get into the litter, and fasten the curtains tightly. Then he got in on the other side, and waited till his attendants came up.
‘What is the matter, O son of a king?’ asked they, breathless with running.
‘I think I am ill; I am cold,’ he said, and signing to the bearers, he drew the curtains, and was carried through the forest right inside his own house.
‘Tell my father and mother that I have a fever, and want some gruel,’ said he, ‘and bid them send it quickly.’
So the slave hastened to the king’s palace and gave his message, which troubled both the king and the queen greatly. A pot of hot gruel was instantly prepared, and carried over to the sick man, and as soon as the council which was sitting was over, the king and his ministers went to pay him a visit, bearing a message from the queen that she would follow a little later.
Now the prince had pretended to be ill in order to soften his parent’s hearts, and the next day he declared he felt better, and, getting into his litter, was carried to the palace in state, drums being beaten all along the road.
He dismounted at the foot of the steps and walked up, a great parasol being held over his head by a slave. Then he entered the cool, dark room where his father and mother were sitting, and said to them:
‘I saw a girl yesterday in the forest whom I wish to marry, and, unknown to my attendants, I brought her back to my house in a litter. Give me your consent, I beg, for no other woman pleases me as well, even though she has but one hand!’
Of course the king and queen would have preferred a daughter-in- law with two hands, and one who could have brought riches with her, but they could not bear to say ‘No’ to their son, so they told him it should be as he chose, and that the wedding feast should be prepared immediately.
The girl could scarcely believe her good fortune, and, in gratitude for all the kindness shown her, was so useful and pleasant to her husband’s parents that they soon loved her.
By and bye a baby was born to her, and soon after that the prince was sent on a journey by his father to visit some of the distant towns of the kingdom, and to set right things that had gone wrong.
No sooner had he started than the girl’s brother, who had wasted all the riches his wife had brought him in recklessness and folly, and was now very poor, chanced to come into the town, and as he passed he heard a man say, ‘Do you know that the king’s son has married a woman who has lost one of her hands?’ On hearing these words the brother stopped and asked, ‘Where did he find such a woman?’
‘In the forest,’ answered the man, and the cruel brother guessed at once it must be his sister.
A great rage took possession of his soul as he thought of the girl whom he had tried to ruin being after all so much better off than himself, and he vowed that he would work her ill. Therefore that very afternoon he made his way to the palace and asked to see the king.
When he was admitted to his presence, he knelt down and touched the ground with his forehead, and the king bade him stand up and tell wherefore he had come.
‘By the kindness of your heart have you been deceived, O king,’ said he. ‘Your son has married a girl who has lost a hand. Do you know why she had lost it? She was a witch, and has wedded three husbands, and each husband she has put to death with her arts. Then the people of the town cut off her hand, and turned her into the forest. And what I say is true, for her town is my town also.’
The king listened, and his face grew dark. Unluckily he had a hasty temper, and did not stop to reason, and, instead of sending to the town, and discovering people who knew his daughter-in-law and could have told him how hard she had worked and how poor she had been, he believed all the brother’s lying words, and made the queen believe them too. Together they took counsel what they should do, and in the end they decided that they also would put her out of the town. But this did not content the brother.
‘Kill her,’ he said. ‘It is no more than she deserves for daring to marry the king’s son. Then she can do no more hurt to anyone.’
‘We cannot kill her,’ answered they; ‘if we did, our son would assuredly kill us. Let us do as the others did, and put her out of the town. And with this the envious brother was forced to be content.
The poor girl loved her husband very much, but just then the baby was more to her than all else in the world, and as long as she had him with her, she did not very much mind anything. So, taking her son on her arm, and hanging a little earthen pot for cooking round her neck, she left her house with its great peacock fans and slaves and seats of ivory, and plunged into the forest.
For a while she walked, not knowing whither she went, then by and bye she grew tired, and sat under a tree to rest and to hush her baby to sleep. Suddenly she raised her eyes, and saw a snake wriggling from under the bushes towards her.
‘I am a dead woman,’ she said to herself, and stayed quite still, for indeed she was too frightened to move. In another minute the snake had reached her side, and to her surprise he spoke.
‘Open your earthen pot, and let me go in. Save me from sun, and I will save you from rain,’ and she opened the pot, and when the snake had slipped in, she put on the cover. Soon she beheld another snake coming after the other one, and when it had reached her it stopped and said, ‘Did you see a small grey snake pass this way just now?’
‘Yes,’ she answered, ‘it was going very quickly.’
‘Ah, I must hurry and catch it up,’ replied the second snake, and it hastened on.
When it was out of sight, a voice from the pot said:
‘Uncover me,’ and she lifted the lid, and the little grey snake slid rapidly to the ground.
‘I am safe now,’ he said. ‘But tell me, where are you going?’
‘I cannot tell you, for I do not know,’ she answered. ‘I am just wandering in the wood.’
‘Follow me, and let us go home together,’ said the snake, and the girl followed his through the forest and along the green paths, till they came to a great lake, where they stopped to rest.
‘The sun is hot,’ said the snake, ‘and you have walked far. Take your baby and bathe in that cool place where the boughs of the tree stretch far over the water.’
‘Yes, I will,’ answered she, and they went in. The baby splashed and crowed with delight, and then he gave a spring and fell right in, down, down, down, and his mother could not find him, though she searched all among the reeds.
Full of terror, she made her way back to the bank, and called to the snake, ‘My baby is gone!–he is drowned, and never shall I see him again.’
‘Go in once more,’ said the snake, ‘and feel everywhere, even among the trees that have their roots in the water, lest perhaps he may be held fast there.’
Swiftly she went back and felt everywhere with her whole hand, even putting her fingers into the tiniest crannies, where a crab could hardly have taken shelter.
‘No, he is not here,’ she cried. ‘How am I to live without him?’ But the snake took no notice, and only answered, ‘Put in your other arm too.’
‘What is the use of that?’ she asked, ‘when it has no hand to feel with?’ but all the same she did as she was bid, and in an instant the wounded arm touched something round and soft, lying between two stones in a clump of reeds.
‘My baby, my baby!’ she shouted, and lifted him up, merry and laughing, and not a bit hurt or frightened.
‘Have you found him this time?’ asked the snake.
‘Yes, oh, yes!’ she answered, ‘and, why–why–I have got my hand back again!’ and from sheer joy she burst into tears.
The snake let her weep for a little while, and then he said–
‘Now we will journey on to my family, and we will all repay you for the kindness you showed to me.’
‘You have done more than enough in giving me back my hand,’ replied the girl; but the snake only smiled.
‘Be quick, lest the sun should set,’ he answered, and began to wriggle along so fast that the girl could hardly follow him.
By and bye they arrived at the house in a tree where the snake lived, when he was not travelling with his father and mother. And he told them all his adventures, and how he had escaped from his enemy. The father and mother snake could not do enough to show their gratitude. They made their guest lie down on a hammock woven of the strong creepers which hung from bough to bough, till she was quite rested after her wanderings, while they watched the baby and gave him milk to drink from the cocoa-nuts which they persuaded their friends the monkeys to crack for them. They even managed to carry small fruit tied up in their tails for the baby’s mother, who felt at last that she was safe and at peace. Not that she forgot her husband, for she often thought of him and longed to show him her son, and in the night she would sometimes lie awake and wonder where he was.
In this manner many weeks passed by.
And what was the prince doing?
Well, he had fallen very ill when he was on the furthest border of the kingdom, and he was nursed by some kind people who did not know who he was, so that the king and queen heard nothing about him. When he was better he made his way home again, and into his father’s palace, where he found a strange man standing behind the throne with the peacock’s feathers. This was his wife’s brother, whom the king had taken into high favour, though, of course, the prince was quite ignorant of what had happened.
For a moment the king and queen stared at their son, as if he had been unknown to them; he had grown so thin and weak during his illness that his shoulders were bowed like those of an old man.
‘Have you forgotten me so soon?’ he asked.
At the sound of his voice they gave a cry and ran towards him, and poured out questions as to what had happened, and why he looked like that. But the prince did not answer any of them.
‘How is my wife?’ he said. There was a pause.
Then the queen replied:
‘She is dead.’
‘Dead!’ he repeated, stepping a little backwards. ‘And my child?’
‘He is dead too.’
The young man stood silent. Then he said, ‘Show me their graves.’
At these words the king, who had been feeling rather uncomfortable, took heart again, for had he not prepared two beautiful tombs for his son to see, so that he might never, never guess what had been done to his wife? All these months the king and queen had been telling each other how good and merciful they had been not to take her brother’s advice and to put her to death. But now, this somehow did not seem so certain.
Then the king led the way to the courtyard just behind the palace, and through the gate into a beautiful garden where stood two splendid tombs in a green space under the trees. The prince advanced alone, and, resting his head against the stone, he burst into tears. His father and mother stood silently behind with a curious pang in their souls which they did not quite understand. Could it be that they were ashamed of themselves?
But after a while the prince turned round, and walking past them in to the palace he bade the slaves bring him mourning. For seven days no one saw him, but at the end of them he went out hunting, and helped his father rule his people. Only no one dared to speak to him of his wife and son.
At last one morning, after the girl had been lying awake all night thinking of her husband, she said to her friend the snake:
‘You have all shown me much kindness, but now I am well again, and want to go home and hear some news of my husband, and if he still mourns for me!’ Now the heart of the snake was sad at her words, but he only said:
‘Yes, thus it must be; go and bid farewell to my father and mother, but if they offer you a present, see that you take nothing but my father’s ring and my mother’s casket.’
So she went to the parent snakes, who wept bitterly at the thought of losing her, and offered her gold and jewels as much as she could carry in remembrance of them. But the girl shook her head and pushed the shining heap away from her.
‘I shall never forget you, never,’ she said in a broken voice, ‘but the only tokens I will accept from you are that little ring and this old casket.’
The two snakes looked at each other in dismay. The ring and the casket were the only things they did not want her to have. Then after a short pause they spoke.
‘Why do you want the ring and casket so much? Who has told you of them?’
‘Oh, nobody; it is just my fancy,’ answered she. But the old snakes shook their heads and replied:
‘Not so; it is our son who told you, and, as he said, so it must be. If you need food, or clothes, or a house, tell the ring and it will find them for you. And if you are unhappy or in danger, tell the casket and it will set things right.’ Then they both gave her their blessing, and she picked up her baby and went her way.
She walked for a long time, till at length she came near the town where her husband and his father dwelt. Here she stopped under a grove of palm trees, and told the ring that she wanted a house.
‘It is ready, mistress,’ whispered a queer little voice which made her jump, and, looking behind her, she saw a lovely palace made of the finest woods, and a row of slaves with tall fans bowing before the door. Glad indeed was she to enter, for she was very tired, and, after eating a good supper of fruit and milk which she found in one of the rooms, she flung herself down on a pile of cushions and went to sleep with her baby beside her.
Here she stayed quietly, and every day the baby grew taller and stronger, and very soon he could run about and even talk. Of course the neighbours had a great deal to say about the house which had been built so quickly–so very quickly–on the outskirts of the town, and invented all kinds of stories about the rich lady who lived in it. And by and bye, when the king returned with his son from the wars, some of these tales reached his ears.
‘It is really very odd about that house under the palms,’ he said to the queen; ‘I must find out something of the lady whom no one ever sees. I daresay it is not a lady at all, but a gang of conspirators who want to get possession of my throne. To-morrow I shall take my son and my chief ministers and insist on getting inside.’
Soon after sunrise next day the prince’s wife was standing on a little hill behind the house, when she saw a cloud of dust coming through the town. A moment afterwards she heard faintly the roll of the drums that announced the king’s presence, and saw a crowd of people approaching the grove of palms. Her heart beat fast. Could her husband be among them? In any case they must not discover her there; so just bidding the ring prepare some food for them, she ran inside, and bound a veil of golden gauze round her head and face. Then, taking the child’s hand, she went to the door and waited.
In a few minutes the whole procession came up, and she stepped forward and begged them to come in and rest.
‘Willingly,’ answered the king; ‘go first, and we will follow you.’
They followed her into a long dark room, in which was a table covered with gold cups and baskets filled with dates and cocoa- nuts and all kinds of ripe yellow fruits, and the king and the prince sat upon cushions and were served by slaves, while the ministers, among whom she recognised her own brother, stood behind.
‘Ah, I owe all my misery to him,’ she said to herself. ‘From the first he has hated me,’ but outwardly she showed nothing. And when the king asked her what news there was in the town she only answered:
‘You have ridden far; eat first, and drink, for you must be hungry and thirsty, and then I will tell you my news.’
‘You speak sense,’ answered the king, and silence prevailed for some time longer. Then he said:
‘Now, lady, I have finished, and am refreshed, therefore tell me, I pray you, who you are, and whence you come? But, first, be seated.’
She bowed her head and sat down on a big scarlet cushion, drawing her little boy, who was asleep in a corner, on to her knee, and began to tell the story of her life. As her brother listened, he would fain have left the house and hidden himself in the forest, but it was his duty to wave the fan of peacock’s feathers over the king’s head to keep off the flies, and he knew he would be seized by the royal guards if he tried to desert his post. He must stay where he was, there was no help for it, and luckily for him the king was too much interested in the tale to notice that the fan had ceased moving, and that flies were dancing right on the top of his thick curly hair.
The story went on, but the story-teller never once looked at the prince, even through her veil, though he on his side never moved his eyes from her. When she reached the part where she had sat weeping in the tree, the king’s son could restrain himself no longer.
‘It is my wife,’ he cried, springing to where she sat with the sleeping child in her lap. ‘They have lied to me, and you are not dead after all, nor the boy either.! But what has happened? Why did they lie to me? and why did you leave my house where you were safe?’ And he turned and looked fiercely at his father.
‘Let me finish my tale first, and then you will know,’ answered she, throwing back her veil, and she told how her brother had come to the palace and accused her of being a witch, and had tried to persuade the king to slay her. ‘But he would not do that,’ she continued softly, ‘and after all, if I had stayed on in your house, I should never have met the snake, nor have got my hand back again. So let us forget all about it, and be happy once more, for see! our son is growing quite a big boy.’
‘And what shall be done to your brother?’ asked the king, who was glad to think that someone had acted in this matter worse than himself.
‘Put him out of the town,’ answered she.

It was winter in the Great Karroo. The evening air was so crisp and cutting that one seemed tohearthe crick-crack of the frost, as it formed on the scant vegetation. Askraal windjeblew from the distant mountains, bringing with it a mingled odour of karroo-bush, sheep-kraals, and smoke from the Kafir huts—none, perhaps, desirable in itself, but all so blent and purified in that rare, clear atmosphere, and so subservient to the exhilarating freshness, that Pietie van der Merwe took several sniffs of pleasure as he peered into the pale moonlight over the lower half of the divided door. Then, with a little involuntary shiver, he closed the upper portion and turned to the ruddy warmth of the purring fire, which Willem was feeding with mealie-cobs from the basket beside him.
Little Jan sat in the corner of the wide, old-fashioned rustbank, his large grey eyes gazing wistfully into the red heart of the fire, while his hand absently stroked Torry, the fox terrier, curled up beside him.
Mother, in her big Madeira chair at the side table, yawned a little over her book; for, winter or summer, the mistress of a karroo farm leads a busy life, and the end of the day finds her ready for a well-earned rest.
Pietie held his hands towards the blaze, turning his head now and again towards the door at the far end of the room. Presently this opened and father appeared, comfortably and leisurely, as if such things as shearing, dipping, and ploughing were no part of his day’s work. Only the healthy tan, the broad shoulders, the whole well-developed physique proclaimed his strenuous, open-air life. His eye rested with pleasure on the scene before him—the bright fire, throwing gleam and shadow on painted wall and polished woodwork, and giving a general air of cosiness to everything; the table spread for the evening meal; the group at the fireside; and his dear helpmate who was responsible for the comfort and happiness of his well-appointed home.
He was followed in a moment by Cousin Minnie, the bright-faced young governess. Their coming caused a stir among the children. Little Jan slowly withdrew his gaze from the fire, and, with more energy than might have been expected from his dreamy look, pushed and prodded the sleeping terrier along the rustbank so as to make room for Cousin Minnie.
Pietie sprang to his father’s side. “Nowmay I go and call Outa Karel?” he asked eagerly, and at an acquiescent “Yes, my boy,” away he sped.
It was a strange figure that came at his bidding, shuffling, stooping, halting, and finally emerging into the firelight. A stranger might have been forgiven for fleeing in terror, for the new arrival looked like nothing so much as an ancient and muscular gorilla in man’s clothes, and walking uncertainly on its hind legs.
He was not quite four feet in height, with shoulders and hips disproportionately broad, and long arms, the hands of which reached midway between knee and ankle. His lower limbs were clothed in nondescript garments fashioned from wildcat and dassie skins; a faded brown coat, which from its size had evidently once belonged to his master, hung nearly to his knees; while, when he removed his shapeless felt hat, a red kopdoek was seen to be wound tightly round his head. No one had ever seen Outa Karel without his kopdoek, but it was reported that the head it covered was as smooth and devoid of hair as an ostrich egg.
His yellow-brown face was a network of wrinkles, across which his flat nose sprawled broadly between high cheekbones; his eyes, sunk far back into his head, glittered dark and beady like the little wicked eyes of a snake peeping from the shadow of a hole in the rocks. His wide mouth twisted itself into an engaging grin, which extended from ear to ear, as, winking and blinking his bright little eyes, he twirled his old hat in his claw-like hands and tried to make obeisance to his master and mistress.
The attempt was unsuccessful on account of the stiffness of his joints, but it never failed to amuse those who, times without number, had seen it repeated. To those who witnessed it for the first time it was something to be remembered—the grotesque, disproportionate form; the ape-like face, that yet was so curiously human; the humour and kindness that gleamed from the cavernous eyes, which seemed designed to express only malevolence and cunning; the long waving arms and crooked fingers; the yellow skin for all the world like a crumpled sheet of india-rubber pulled in a dozen different directions.
That he was a consummate actor, and, not to put too fine a point on it, an old humbug of the first water, goes without saying, for these characteristics are inherent in the native nature. But in spite of this, and the uncanniness of his appearance, there was something about Outa Karel that drew one to him. Of his real devotion to his master and the “beautiful family Van der Merwe,” there could be no question; while, above everything, was the feeling that here was one of an outcast race, one of the few of the original inhabitants who had survived the submerging tide of civilization; who, knowing no law but that of possession, had been scared and chased from their happy hunting grounds, first by the Hottentots, then by the powerful Bantu, and later by the still more terrifying palefaced tribes from over the seas. Though the origin of the Bushman is lost in the mists of antiquity, the Hottentot conquest of him is a matter of history, and it is well known that the victors were in the habit, while killing off the men, to take unto themselves wives from among the women of the vanquished race. Hence the fact that a perfect specimen of a Bushman is arara avis, even in the localities where the last remnants are known to linger.
Outa Karel could hardly be called a perfect specimen of the original race, for, though he always spoke of himself as wholly Bushman, there was a strong strain of the Hottentot about him, chiefly noticeable in his build.
He spoke in Dutch, in the curiously expressive voice belonging to these people, just now honey-sweet with the deference he felt for his superiors.
“Ach toch! Night, Baas. Night, Nooi. Night, Nonnie and my little baasjes. Excuse that this old Bushman does not bend to greet you; the will is there, but his knees are too stiff. Thank you, thank you, my baasje,” as Pietie dragged a low stool, covered with springbok skin, from under the desk in the recess and pushed it towards him. He settled himself on it slowly and carefully, with much creaking of joints and many strange native ejaculations.
The little group had arranged itself anew. Cousin Minnie was in the cosy corner of the rustbank near the wall, little Jan next her with his head against her, and Torry’s head on his lap—this attention to make up for his late seeming unkindness in pushing him away.
Pappa, with his magazine, was at the other end of the rustbank where he could, if he chose, speak to Mamma in a low tone, or peep over to see how her book was getting on. Willem had pushed the basket away so as to settle himself more comfortably against Cousin Minnie’s knee as he sat on the floor, and Pietie was on a small chair just in front of the fire.
The centre of attention was the quaint old native, who, having relegated his duties to his children and grandchildren, lived as a privileged pensioner in the van der Merwe family he had served so faithfully for three generations. The firelight played over his quaint figure with the weirdest effect, lighting up now one portion of it, now another, showing up his astonishingly small hands and crooked fingers, as he pointed and gesticulated incessantly—for these people speak as much by gesture as by sound—and throwing exaggerated shadows on the wall.
This was the hour beloved by the children, when the short wintry day had ended, and, in the interval between the coming of darkness and the evening meal, their dear Outa Karel was allowed in to tell them stories.
And weird and wonderful stories they were—tales of spooks and giants, of good and bad spirits, of animals that talked, of birds, beasts and insects that exercised marvellous influence over the destinies of unsuspecting mankind. But most thrilling of all, perhaps, were Outa Karel’s personal experiences—adventures by veld and krantz with lion, tiger, jackal and crocodile, such as no longer fall to the lot of mortal man.
The children would listen, wide-eyed and breathless, and even their elders, sparing a moment’s attention from book or writing, would feel a tremor of excitement, unable to determine where reality ended and fiction began, so inextricably were they intermingled as this old Iago of the desert wove his romances.
“Now, Outa, tell us a nice story, the nicest you know,” said little Jan, nestling closer to Cousin Minnie, and issuing his command as the autocrat of the “One Thousand and One Nights” might have done.
“Ach! but klein baas, this stupid old black one knows no new stories, only the old ones of Jakhals and Leeuw, and how can he tell even those when his throat is dry—ach, so dry with the dust from the kraals?”
He forced a gurgling cough, and his small eyes glittered expectantly. Then suddenly he started with well-feigned surprise and beamed on Pietie, who stood beside him with a soopje in the glass kept for his especial use.
This was a nightly performance. The lubrication was never forgotten, but it was often purposely delayed in order to see what pretext Outa would use to call attention to the fact of its not having been offered. Sore throat, headache, stomach-ache, cold, heat, rheumatism, old age, a birthday (invented for the occasion), the killing of a snake or the breaking-in of a young horse—anything served as an excuse for what was a time-honoured custom.
“Thank you, thank you,mij klein koning. Gezondheid to Baas, Nooi, Nonnie, and the beautiful family van der Merwe.” He lifted the glass, gulped down the contents, and smacked his lips approvingly. “Ach! if a Bushman only had a neck like an ostrich! How good would the soopje taste all the way down! Now I am strong again; now I am ready to tell the story of Jakhals and Oom Leeuw.”
“About Oom Leeuw carrying Jakhals on his back?” asked Willem.
“No, baasje. This is quite a different one.”
And with many strange gesticulations, imitating every action and changing his voice to suit the various characters, the old man began:

There was once upon a time a thief, who, being out of a job, was wandering by himself up and down the seashore. As he walked he passed a man who was standing still, looking at the waves.
‘I wonder,’ said the thief, addressing the stranger, ‘if you have ever seen a stone swimming?’
‘Most certainly I have,’ replied the other man, ‘and, what is more, I saw the same stone jump out of the water and fly through the air.’
‘This is capital,’ replied the thief. ‘You and I must go into partnership. We shall certainly make our fortunes. Let us start together for the palace of the king of the neighbouring country. When we get there, I will go into his presence alone, and will tell him the most startling thing I can invent. Then you must follow and back up my lie.’
Having agreed to do this, they set out on their travels. After several days’ journeying, they reached the town where the king’s palace was, and here they parted for a few hours, while the thief sought an interview with the king, and begged his majesty to give him a glass of beer.
‘That is impossible,’ said the king, ‘as this year there has been a failure of all the crops, and of the hops and the vines; so we have neither wine nor beer in the whole kingdom.’
‘How extraordinary!’ answered the thief. ‘I have just come from a country where the crops were so fine that I saw twelve barrels of beer made out of one branch of hops.’
‘I bet you three hundred florins that is not true,’ answered the king.
‘And I bet you three hundred florins it is true,’ replied the thief.
Then each staked his three hundred florins, and the king said he would decide the question by sending a servant into that country to see if it was true.
So the servant set out on horseback, and on the way he met a man, and he asked him whence he came. And the man told him that he came from the self-same country to which the servant was at that moment bound.
‘If that is the case,’ said the servant, ‘you can tell me how high the hops grow in your country, and how many barrels of beer can be brewed from one branch?’
‘I can’t tell you that,’ answered the man, ‘but I happened to be present when the hops were being gathered in, and I saw that it took three men with axes three days to cut down one branch.’
Then the servant thought that he might save himself a long journey; so he gave the man ten florins, and told him he must repeat to the king what he had just told him. And when they got back to the palace, they came together into the king’s presence.
And the king asked him: ‘Well, is it true about the hops?’
‘Yes, sire, it is,’ answered the servant; ‘and here is a man I have brought with me from the country to confirm the tale.’
So the king paid the thief the three hundred florins; and the partners once more set out together in search of adventures. As they journeyed, the thief said to his comrade: ‘I will now go to another king, and will tell him something still more startling; and you must follow and back up my lie, and we shall get some money out of him; just see if we don’t.’
When they reached the next kingdom, the thief presented himself to the king, and requested him to give him a cauliflower. And the king answered: ‘Owing to a blight among the vegetables we have no cauliflower.’
‘That is strange,’ answered the thief. ‘I have just come from a country where it grows so well that one head of cauliflower filled twelve water-tubs.’
‘I don’t believe it,’ answered the king.
‘I bet you six hundred florins it is true,’ replied the thief.
‘And I bet you six hundred florins it is not true,’ answered the king. And he sent for a servant, and ordered him to start at once for the country whence the thief had come, to find out if his story of the cauliflower was true. On his journey the servant met with a man. Stopping his horse he asked him where he came from, and the man replied that he came from the country to which the other was travelling.
‘If that is the case,’ said the servant, ‘you can tell me to what size cauliflower grows in your country? Is it so large that one head fills twelve water-tubs?’
‘I have not seen that,’ answered the man. ‘But I saw twelve waggons, drawn by twelve horses, carrying one head of cauliflower to the market.’
And the servant answered: ‘Here are ten florins for you, my man, for you have saved me a long journey. Come with me now, and tell the king what you have just told me.’
‘All right,’ said the man, and they went together to the palace; and when the king asked the servant if he had found out the truth about the cauliflower, the servant replied: ‘Sire, all that you heard was perfectly true; here is a man from the country who will tell you so.’
So the king had to pay the thief the six hundred florins. And the two partners set out once more on their travels, with their nine hundred florins. When they reached the country of the neighbouring king, the thief entered the royal presence, and began conversation by asking if his majesty knew that in an adjacent kingdom there was a town with a church steeple on which a bird had alighted, and that the steeple was so high, and the bird’s beak so long, that it had pecked the stars till some of them fell out of the sky.
‘I don’t believe it,’ said the king.
‘Nevertheless I am prepared to bet twelve hundred florins that it is true,’ answered the thief.
‘And I bet twelve hundred florins that it is a lie,’ replied the king. And he straightway sent a servant into the neighbouring country to find out the truth.
As he rode, the servant met a man coming in the opposite direction. So he hailed him and asked him where he came from. And the man replied that he came out of the very town to which the man was bound. Then the servant asked him if the story they had heard about the bird with the long beak was true.
‘I don’t know about that,’ answered the man, ‘as I have never seen the bird; but I once saw twelve men shoving all their might and main with brooms to push a monster egg into a cellar.’
‘That is capital,’ answered the servant, presenting the man with ten florins. ‘Come and tell your tale to the king, and you will save me a long journey.’
So, when the story was repeated to the king, there was nothing for him to do but to pay the thief the twelve hundred florins.
Then the two partners set out again with their ill- gotten gains, which they proceeded to divide into two equal shares; but the thief kept back three of the florins that belonged to the liar’s half of the booty. Shortly afterwards they each married, and settled down in homes of their own with their wives. One day the liar discovered that he had been done out of three florins by his partner, so he went to his house and demanded them from him.
‘Come next Saturday, and I will give them to you,’ answered the thief. But as he had no intention of giving the liar the money, when Saturday morning came he stretched himself out stiff and stark upon the bed, and told his wife she was to say he was dead. So the wife rubbed her eyes with an onion, and when the liar appeared at the door, she met him in tears, and told him that as her husband was dead he could not be paid the three florins.
But the liar, who knew his partner’s tricks, instantly suspected the truth, and said: ‘As he has not paid me, I will pay him out with three good lashes of my riding whip.’
At these words the thief sprang to his feet, and, appearing at the door, promised his partner that if he would return the following Saturday he would pay him. So the liar went away satisfied with this promise.
But when Saturday morning came the thief got up early and hid himself under a truss of hay in the hay- loft.
When the liar appeared to demand his three florins, the wife met him with tears in her eyes, and told him that her husband was dead.
‘Where have you buried him?’ asked the liar.
‘In the hay-loft,’ answered the wife.
‘Then I will go there, and take away some hay in payment of his debt,’ said the liar. And proceeding to the hay-loft, he began to toss about the hay with a pitchfork, prodding it into the trusses of hay, till, in terror of his life, the thief crept out and promised his partner to pay him the three florins on the following Saturday.
When the day came he got up at sunrise, and going down into the crypt of a neighbouring chapel, stretched himself out quite still and stiff in an old stone coffin. But the liar, who was quite as clever as his partner, very soon bethought him of the crypt, and set out for the chapel, confident that he would shortly discover the hiding-place of his friend. He had just entered the crypt, and his eyes were not yet accustomed to the darkness, when he heard the sound of whispering at the grated windows. Listening intently, he overheard the plotting of a band of robbers, who had brought their treasure to the crypt, meaning to hide it there, while they set out on fresh adventures. All the time they were speaking they were removing the bars from the window, and in another minute they would all have entered the crypt, and discovered the liar. Quick as thought he wound his mantle round him and placed himself, standing stiff and erect, in a niche in the wall, so that in the dim light he looked just like an old stone statue. As soon as the robbers entered the crypt, they set about the work of dividing their treasure. Now, there were twelve robbers, but by mistake the chief of the band divided the gold into thirteen heaps. When he saw his mistake he said they had not time to count it all over again, but that the thirteenth heap should belong to whoever among them could strike off the head of the old stone statue in the niche with one stroke. With these words he took up an axe, and approached the niche where the liar was standing. But, just as he had waved the axe over his head ready to strike, a voice was heard from the stone coffin saying, in sepulchral tones: ‘Clear out of this, or the dead will arise from their coffins, and the statues will descend from the walls, and you will be driven out more dead than alive.’
And with a bound the thief jumped out of his coffin and the liar from his niche, and the robbers were so terrified that they ran helter-skelter out of the crypt, leaving all their gold behind them, and vowing that they would never put foot inside the haunted place again. So the partners divided the gold between them, and carried it to their homes; and history tells us no more about them.

Once there was a very learned physician, who died leaving his wife with a little baby boy, whom, when he was old enough, she named, according to his father’s wish, Hassee′boo Kareem′ Ed Deen′.
When the boy had been to school, and had learned to read, his mother sent him to a tailor, to learn his trade, but he could not learn it. Then he was sent to a silversmith, but he could not learn his trade either. After that he tried many trades, but could learn none of them. At last his mother said, “Well, stay at home for a while;” and that seemed to suit him.
One day he asked his mother what his father’s business had been, and she told him he was a very great physician.
“Where are his books?” he asked.
“Well, it’s a long time since I saw them,” replied his mother, “but I think they are behind there. Look and see.”
So he hunted around a little and at last found them, but they were almost ruined by insects, and he gained little from them.
At last, four of the neighbors came to his mother and said, “Let your boy go along with us and cut wood in the forest.” It was their business to cut wood, load it on donkeys, and sell it in the town for making fires.
“All right,” said she; “to-morrow I’ll buy him a donkey, and he can start fair with you.”
So the next day Hasseeboo, with his donkey, went off with those four persons, and they worked very hard and made a lot of money that day. This continued for six days, but on the seventh day it rained heavily, and they had to get under the rocks to keep dry.
Now, Hasseeboo sat in a place by himself, and, having nothing else to do, he picked up a stone and began knocking on the ground with it. To his surprise the ground gave forth a hollow sound, and he called to his companions, saying, “There seems to be a hole under here.”
Upon hearing him knock again, they decided to dig and see what was the cause of the hollow sound; and they had not gone very deep before they broke into a large pit, like a well, which was filled to the top with honey.
They didn’t do any firewood chopping after that, but devoted their entire attention to the collection and sale of the honey.
With a view to getting it all out as quickly as possible, they told Hasseeboo to go down into the pit and dip out the honey, while they put it in vessels and took it to town for sale. They worked for three days, making a great deal of money.
At last there was only a little honey left at the very bottom of the pit, and they told the boy to scrape that together while they went to get a rope to haul him out.
But instead of getting the rope, they decided to let him remain in the pit, and divide the money among themselves. So, when he had gathered the remainder of the honey together, and called for the rope, he received no answer; and after he had been alone in the pit for three days he became convinced that his companions had deserted him.
Then those four persons went to his mother and told her that they had become separated in the forest, that they had heard a lion roaring, and that they could find no trace of either her son or his donkey.
His mother, of course, cried very much, and the four neighbors pocketed her son’s share of the money.
To return to Hasseeboo.
He passed the time walking about the pit, wondering what the end would be, eating scraps of honey, sleeping a little, and sitting down to think.
While engaged in the last occupation, on the fourth day, he saw a scorpion fall to the ground—a large one, too—and he killed it.
Then suddenly he thought to himself, “Where did that scorpion come from? There must be a hole somewhere. I’ll search, anyhow.”
So he searched around until he saw light through a tiny crack; and he took his knife and scooped and scooped, until he had made a hole big enough to pass through; then he went out, and came upon a place he had never seen before.
Seeing a path, he followed it until he came to a very large house, the door of which was not fastened. So he went inside, and saw golden doors, with golden locks, and keys of pearl, and beautiful chairs inlaid with jewels and precious stones, and in a reception room he saw a couch covered with a splendid spread, upon which he lay down.
Presently he found himself being lifted off the couch and put in a chair, and heard some one saying: “Do not hurt him; wake him gently,” and on opening his eyes he found himself surrounded by numbers of snakes, one of them wearing beautiful royal colors.
“Hullo!” he cried; “who are you?”
“I am Sulta′nee Waa′ Neeo′ka, king of the snakes, and this is my house. Who are you?”
“I am Hasseeboo Kareem Ed Deen.”
“Where do you come from?”
“I don’t know where I come from, or where I’m going.”
“Well, don’t bother yourself just now. Let’s eat; I guess you are hungry, and I know I am.”
Then the king gave orders, and some of the other snakes brought the finest fruits, and they ate and drank and conversed.
When the repast was ended, the king desired to hear Hasseeboo’s story; so he told him all that had happened, and then asked to hear the story of his host.
“Well,” said the king of the snakes, “mine is rather a long story, but you shall hear it. A long time ago I left this place, to go and live in the mountains of Al Kaaf′, for the change of air. One day I saw a stranger coming along, and I said to him, ‘Where are you from?’ and he said, ‘I am wandering in the wilderness.’ ‘Whose son are you?’ I asked. ‘My name is Bolookee′a. My father was a sultan; and when he died I opened a small chest, inside of which I found a bag, which contained a small brass box; when I had opened this I found some writing tied up in a woolen cloth, and it was all in praise of a prophet. He was described as such a good and wonderful man, that I longed to see him; but when I made inquiries concerning him I was told he was not yet born. Then I vowed I would wander until I should see him. So I left our town, and all my property, and I am wandering, but I have not yet seen that prophet.’
“Then I said to him, ‘Where do you expect to find him, if he’s not yet born? Perhaps if you had some serpent’s water you might keep on living until you find him. But it’s of no use talking about that; the serpent’s water is too far away.’
“‘Well,’ he said, ‘good-bye. I must wander on.’ So I bade him farewell, and he went his way.
“Now, when that man had wandered until he reached Egypt, he met another man, who asked him, ‘Who are you?’
“‘I am Bolookeea. Who are you?’
“‘My name is Al Faan′. Where are you going?’
“‘I have left my home, and my property, and I am seeking the prophet.
“‘H’m!’ said Al Faan; ‘I can tell you of a better occupation than looking for a man that is not born yet. Let us go and find the king of the snakes and get him to give us a charm medicine; then we will go to King Solomon and get his rings, and we shall be able to make slaves of the genii and order them to do whatever we wish.’
“And Bolookeea said, ‘I have seen the king of the snakes in the mountain of Al Kaaf.’
“‘All right,’ said Al Faan; ‘let’s go.’
“Now, Al Faan wanted the ring of Solomon that he might be a great magician and control the genii and the birds, while all Bolookeea wanted was to see the great prophet.
“As they went along, Al Faan said to Bolookeea, ‘Let us make a cage and entice the king of the snakes into it; then we will shut the door and carry him off.’
“‘All right,’ said Bolookeea.
“So they made a cage, and put therein a cup of milk and a cup of wine, and brought it to Al Kaaf; and I, like a fool, went in, drank up all the wine and became drunk. Then they fastened the door and took me away with them.
“When I came to my senses I found myself in the cage, and Bolookeea carrying me, and I said, ‘The sons of Adam are no good. What do you want from me?’ And they answered, ‘We want some medicine to put on our feet, so that we may walk upon the water whenever it is necessary in the course of our journey.’ ‘Well,’ said I, ‘go along.’
“We went on until we came to a place where there were a great number and variety of trees; and when those trees saw me, they said, ‘I am medicine for this;’ ‘I am medicine for that;’ ‘I am medicine for the head;’ ‘I am medicine for the feet;’ and presently one tree said, ‘If any one puts my medicine upon his feet he can walk on water.’
“When I told that to those men they said, ‘That is what we want;’ and they took a great deal of it.
“Then they took me back to the mountain and set me free; and we said good-bye and parted.
“When they left me, they went on their way until they reached the sea, when they put the medicine on their feet and walked over. Thus they went many days, until they came near to the place of King Solomon, where they waited while Al Faan prepared his medicines.
“When they arrived at King Solomon’s place, he was sleeping, and was being watched by genii, and his hand lay on his chest, with the ring on his finger.
“As Bolookeea drew near, one of the genii said to him ‘Where are you going?’ And he answered, ‘I’m here with Al Faan; he’s going to take that ring.’ ‘Go back,’ said the genie; ‘keep out of the way. That man is going to die.’
“When Al Faan had finished his preparations, he said to Bolookeea, ‘Wait here for me.’ Then he went forward to take the ring, when a great cry arose, and he was thrown by some unseen force a considerable distance.
“Picking himself up, and still believing in the power of his medicines, he approached the ring again, when a strong breath blew upon him and he was burnt to ashes in a moment.
“While Bolookeea was looking at all this, a voice said, ‘Go your way; this wretched being is dead.’ So he returned; and when he got to the sea again he put the medicine upon his feet and passed over, and continued to wander for many years.
“One morning he saw a man sitting down, and said ‘Good-morning,’ to which the man replied. Then Bolookeea asked him, ‘Who are you?’ and he answered: ‘My name is Jan Shah. Who are you?’ So Bolookeea told him who he was, and asked him to tell him his history. The man, who was weeping and smiling by turns, insisted upon hearing Bolookeea’s story first. After he had heard it he said:
“‘Well, sit down, and I’ll tell you my story from beginning to end. My name is Jan Shah, and my father is Tooeegha′mus, a great sultan. He used to go every day into the forest to shoot game; so one day I said to him, “Father, let me go with you into the forest to-day;” but he said, “Stay at home. You are better there.” Then I cried bitterly, and as I was his only child, whom he loved dearly, he couldn’t stand my tears, so he said: “Very well; you shall go. Don’t cry.”
“‘Thus we went to the forest, and took many attendants with us; and when we reached the place we ate and drank, and then every one set out to hunt.
“‘I and my seven slaves went on until we saw a beautiful gazelle, which we chased as far as the sea without capturing it. When the gazelle took to the water I and four of my slaves took a boat, the other three returning to my father, and we chased that gazelle until we lost sight of the shore, but we caught it and killed it. Just then a great wind began to blow, and we lost our way.
“‘When the other three slaves came to my father, he asked them, “Where is your master?” and they told him about the gazelle and the boat. Then he cried, “My son is lost! My son is lost!” and returned to the town and mourned for me as one dead.
“‘After a time we came to an island, where there were a great many birds. We found fruit and water, we ate and drank, and at night we climbed into a tree and slept till morning.
“‘Then we rowed to a second island, and, seeing no one around, we gathered fruit, ate and drank, and climbed a tree as before. During the night we heard many savage beasts howling and roaring near us.
“‘In the morning we got away as soon as possible, and came to a third island. Looking around for food, we saw a tree full of fruit like red-streaked apples; but, as we were about to pick some, we heard a voice say, “Don’t touch this tree; it belongs to the king.” Toward night a number of monkeys came, who seemed much pleased to see us, and they brought us all the fruit we could eat.
“‘Presently I heard one of them say, “Let us make this man our sultan.” Then another one said: “What’s the use? They’ll all run away in the morning.” But a third one said, “Not if we smash their boat.” Sure enough, when we started to leave in the morning, our boat was broken in pieces. So there was nothing for it but to stay there and be entertained by the monkeys, who seemed to like us very much.
“‘One day, while strolling about, I came upon a great stone house, having an inscription on the door, which said, “When any man comes to this island, he will find it difficult to leave, because the monkeys desire to have a man for their king. If he looks for a way to escape, he will think there is none; but there is one outlet, which lies to the north. If you go in that direction you will come to a great plain, which is infested with lions, leopards, and snakes. You must fight all of them; and if you overcome them you can go forward. You will then come to another great plain, inhabited by ants as big as dogs; their teeth are like those of dogs, and they are very fierce. You must fight these also, and if you overcome them, the rest of the way is clear.”
“‘I consulted with my attendants over this information, and we came to the conclusion that, as we could only die, anyhow, we might as well risk death to gain our freedom.
“‘As we all had weapons, we set forth; and when we came to the first plain we fought, and two of my slaves were killed. Then we went on to the second plain, fought again; my other two slaves were killed, and I alone escaped.
“‘After that I wandered on for many days, living on whatever I could find, until at last I came to a town, where I stayed for some time, looking for employment but finding none.
“‘One day a man came up to me and said, “Are you looking for work?” “I am,” said I. “Come with me, then,” said he; and we went to his house.
“‘When we got there he produced a camel’s skin, and said, “I shall put you in this skin, and a great bird will carry you to the top of yonder mountain. When he gets you there, he will tear this skin off you. You must then drive him away and push down the precious stones you will find there. When they are all down, I will get you down.”
“‘So he put me in the skin; the bird carried me to the top of the mountain and was about to eat me, when I jumped up, scared him away, and then pushed down many precious stones. Then I called out to the man to take me down, but he never answered me, and went away.
“‘I gave myself up for a dead man, but went wandering about, until at last, after passing many days in a great forest, I came to a house, all by itself; the old man who lived in it gave me food and drink, and I was revived.
“‘I remained there a long time, and that old man loved me as if I were his own son.
“‘One day he went away, and giving me the keys, told me I could open the door of every room except one which he pointed out to me.
“‘Of course, when he was gone, this was the first door I opened. I saw a large garden, through which a stream flowed. Just then three birds came and alighted by the side of the stream. Immediately they changed to three most beautiful women. When they had finished bathing, they put on their clothes, and, as I stood watching them, they changed into birds again and flew away.
“‘I locked the door, and went away; but my appetite was gone, and I wandered about aimlessly. When the old man came back, he saw there was something wrong with me, and asked me what was the matter. Then I told him I had seen those beautiful maidens, that I loved one of them very much, and that if I could not marry her I should die.
“‘The old man told me I could not possibly have my wish. He said the three lovely beings were the daughters of the sultan of the genii, and that their home was a journey of three years from where we then were.
“‘I told him I couldn’t help that. He must get her for my wife, or I should die. At last he said, “Well, wait till they come again, then hide yourself and steal the clothes of the one you love so dearly.”
“‘So I waited, and when they came again I stole the clothes of the youngest, whose name was Sayadaa′tee Shems.
“‘When they came out of the water, this one could not find her clothes. Then I stepped forward and said, “I have them.” “Ah,” she begged, “give them to me, their owner; I want to go away.” But I said to her, “I love you very much. I want to marry you.” “I want to go to my father,” she replied. “You cannot go,” said I.
“‘Then her sisters flew away, and I took her into the house, where the old man married us. He told me not to give her those clothes I had taken, but to hide them; because if she ever got them she would fly away to her old home. So I dug a hole in the ground and buried them.
“‘But one day, when I was away from home, she dug them up and put them on; then, saying to the slave I had given her for an attendant, “When your master returns tell him I have gone home; if he really loves me he will follow me,” she flew away.
“‘When I came home they told me this, and I wandered, searching for her, many years. At last I came to a town where one asked me, “Who are you?” and I answered, “I am Jan Shah.” “What was your father’s name?” “Taaeeghamus.” “Are you the man who married our mistress?” “Who is your mistress?” “Sayadaatee Shems.” “I am he!” I cried with delight.
“‘They took me to their mistress, and she brought me to her father and told him I was her husband; and everybody was happy.
“‘Then we thought we should like to visit our old home, and her father’s genii carried us there in three days. We stayed there a year and then returned, but in a short time my wife died. Her father tried to comfort me, and wanted me to marry another of his daughters, but I refused to be comforted, and have mourned to this day. That is my story.’
“Then Bolookeea went on his way, and wandered till he died.”
Next Sultaanee Waa Neeoka said to Hasseeboo, “Now, when you go home you will do me injury.”
Hasseeboo was very indignant at the idea, and said, “I could not be induced to do you an injury. Pray, send me home.”
“I will send you home,” said the king; “but I am sure that you will come back and kill me.”
“Why, I dare not be so ungrateful,” exclaimed Hasseeboo. “I swear I could not hurt you.”
“Well,” said the king of the snakes, “bear this in mind: when you go home, do not go to bathe where there are many people.”
And he said, “I will remember.” So the king sent him home, and he went to his mother’s house, and she was overjoyed to find that he was not dead.
Now, the sultan of the town was very sick; and it was decided that the only thing that could cure him would be to kill the king of the snakes, boil him, and give the soup to the sultan.
For a reason known only to himself, the vizir had placed men at the public baths with this instruction: “If any one who comes to bathe here has a mark on his stomach, seize him and bring him to me.”
When Hasseeboo had been home three days he forgot the warning of Sultaanee Waa Neeoka, and went to bathe with the other people. All of a sudden he was seized by some soldiers, and brought before the vizir, who said, “Take us to the home of the king of the snakes.”
“I don’t know where it is,” said Hasseeboo.
“Tie him up,” commanded the vizir.
So they tied him up and beat him until his back was all raw, and being unable to stand the pain he cried, “Let up! I will show you the place.”
So he led them to the house of the king of the snakes, who, when he saw him, said, “Didn’t I tell you you would come back to kill me?”
“How could I help it?” cried Hasseeboo. “Look at my back!”
“Who has beaten you so dreadfully?” asked the king.
“The vizir.”
“Then there’s no hope for me. But you must carry me yourself.”
As they went along, the king said to Hasseeboo, “When we get to your town I shall be killed and cooked. The first skimming the vizir will offer to you, but don’t you drink it; put it in a bottle and keep it. The second skimming you must drink, and you will become a great physician. The third skimming is the medicine that will cure your sultan. When the vizir asks you if you drank that first skimming say, ‘I did.’ Then produce the bottle containing the first, and say, ‘This is the second, and it is for you.’ The vizir will take it, and as soon as he drinks it he will die, and both of us will have our revenge.”
Everything happened as the king had said. The vizir died, the sultan recovered, and Hasseeboo was loved by all as a great physician.

A long way off, near the sea coast of the east of Africa, there dwelt, once upon a time, a man and his wife. They had two children, a son and a daughter, whom they loved very much, and, like parents in other countries, they often talked of the fine marriages the young people would make some day. Out there both boys and girls marry early, and very soon, it seemed to the mother, a message was sent by a rich man on the other side of the great hills offering a fat herd of oxen in exchange for the girl. Everyone in the house and in the village rejoiced, and the maiden was despatched to her new home. When all was quiet again the father said to his son:
‘Now that we own such a splendid troop of oxen you had better hasten and get yourself a wife, lest some illness should overtake them. Already we have seen in the villages round about one or two damsels whose parents would gladly part with them for less than half the herd. Therefore tell us which you like best, and we will buy her for you.’
But the son answered:
‘Not so; the maidens I have seen do not please me. If, indeed, I must marry, let me travel and find a wife for myself.’
‘It shall be as you wish,’ said the parents; ‘but if by-and-by trouble should come of it, it will be your fault and not ours.’
The youth, however, would not listen; and bidding his father and mother farewell, set out on his search. Far, far away he wandered, over mountains and across rivers, till he reached a village where the people were quite different from those of his own race. He glanced about him and noticed that the girls were fair to look upon, as they pounded maize or stewed something that smelt very nice in earthen pots–especially if you were hot and tired; and when one of the maidens turned round and offered the stranger some dinner, he made up his mind that he would wed her and nobody else.
So he sent a message to her parents asking their leave to take her for his wife, and they came next day to bring their answer.
‘We will give you our daughter,’ said they, ‘if you can pay a good price for her. Never was there so hardworking a girl; and how we shall do without her we cannot tell! Still– no doubt your father and mother will come themselves and bring the price?’
‘No; I have the price with me,’ replied the young man; laying down a handful of gold pieces. ‘Here it is–take it.’
The old couple’s eyes glittered greedily; but custom forbade them to touch the price before all was arranged.
‘At least,’ said they, after a moment’s pause, ‘we may expect them to fetch your wife to her new home?’
‘No; they are not used to travelling,’ answered the bridegroom. ‘Let the ceremony be performed without delay, and we will set forth at once. It is a long journey.’
Then the parents called in the girl, who was lying in the sun outside the hut, and, in the presence of all the village, a goat was killed, the sacred dance took place, and a blessing was said over the heads of the young people. After that the bride was led aside by her father, whose duty it was to bestow on her some parting advice as to her conduct in her married life.
‘Be good to your husband’s parents,’ added he, ‘and always do the will of your husband.’ And the girl nodded her head obediently. Next it was the mother’s turn; and, as was the custom of the tribe, she spoke to her daughter:
‘Will you choose which of your sisters shall go with you to cut your wood and carry your water?’
‘I do not want any of them,’ answered she; ‘they are no use. They will drop the wood and spill the water.’
‘Then will you have any of the other children? There are enough to spare,’ asked the mother again. But the bride said quickly:
‘I will have none of them! You must give me our buffalo, the Rover of the Plain; he alone shall serve me.’
‘What folly you talk!’ cried the parents. ‘Give you our buffalo, the Rover of the Plain? Why, you know that our life depends on him. Here he is well fed and lies on soft grass; but how can you tell what will befall him in another country? The food may be bad, he will die of hunger; and, if he dies we die also.’
‘No, no,’ said the bride; ‘I can look after him as well as you. Get him ready, for the sun is sinking and it is time we set forth.’
So she went away and put together a small pot filled with healing herms, a horn that she used in tending sick people, a little knife, and a calabash containing deer fat; and, hiding these about her, she took leave of her father and mother and started across the mountains by the side of her husband.
But the young man did not see the buffalo that followed them, which had left his home to be the servant of his wife.
No one ever knew how the news spread to the kraal that the young man was coming back, bringing a wife with him; but, somehow or other, when the two entered the village, every man and woman was standing in the road uttering shouts of welcome.
‘Ah, you are not dead after all,’ cried they; ‘and have found a wife to your liking, though you would have none of our girls. Well, well, you have chosen your own path; and if ill comes of it beware lest you grumble.’
Next day the husband took his wife to the fields and showed her which were his, and which belonged to his mother. The girl listened carefully to all he told her, and walked with him back to the hut; but close to the door she stopped, and said:
‘I have dropped my necklace of beads in the field, and I must go and look for it.’ But in truth she had done nothing of the sort, and it was only an excuse to go and seek the buffalo.
The beast was crouching under a tree when she came up, and snorted with pleasure at the sight of her.
‘You can roam about this field, and this, and this,’ she said, ‘for they belong to my husband; and that is his wood, where you may hide yourself. But the other fields are his mother’s, so beware lest you touch them.’
‘I will beware,’ answered the buffalo; and, patting his head, the girl left him.
Oh, how much better a servant he was than any of the little girls the bride had refused to bring with her! If she wanted water, she had only to cross the patch of maize behind the hut and seek out the place where the buffalo lay hidden, and put down her pail beside him. Then she would sit at her ease while he went to the lake and brought the bucket back brimming over. If she wanted wood, he would break the branches off the trees and lay them at her feet. And the villagers watched her return laden, and said to each other:
‘Surely the girls of her country are stronger than our girls, for none of them could cut so quickly or carry so much!’ But then, nobody knew that she had a buffalo for a servant.
Only, all this time she never gave the poor buffalo anything to eat, because she had just one dish, out of which she and her husband ate; while in her old home there was a dish put aside expressly for the Rover of the Plain. The buffalo bore it as long as he could; but, one day, when his mistress bade him go to the lake and fetch water, his knees almost gave way from hunger. He kept silence, however, till the evening, when he said to his mistress:
‘I am nearly starved; I have not touched food since I came here. I can work no more.’
‘Alas!’ answered she, ‘what can I do? I have only one dish in the house. You will have to steal some beans from the fields. Take a few here and a few there; but be sure not to take too many from one place, or the owner may notice it.’
Now the buffalo had always lived an honest life, but if his mistress did not feed him, he must get food for himself. So that night, when all the village was asleep, he came out from the wood and ate a few beans here and a few there, as his mistress had bidden him. And when at last his hunger was satisfied, he crept back to his lair. But a buffalo is not a fairy, and the next morning, when the women arrived to work in the fields, they stood still with astonishment, and said to each other:
‘Just look at this; a savage beast has been destroying our crops, and we can see the traces of his feet!’ And they hurried to their homes to tell their tale.
In the evening the girl crept out to the buffalo’s hiding-place, and said to him:
‘They perceived what happened, of course; so to-night you had better seek your supper further off.’ And the buffalo nodded his head and followed her counsel; but in the morning, when these women also went out to work, the races of hoofs were plainly to be seen, and they hastened to tell their husbands, and begged them to bring their guns, and to watch for the robber.
It happened that the stranger girl’s husband was the best marksman in all the village, and he hid himself behind the trunk of a tree and waited.
The buffalo, thinking that they would probably make a search for him in the fields he had laid waste the evening before, returned to the bean patch belonging to his mistress.
The young man saw him coming with amazement.
‘Why, it is a buffalo!’ cried he; ‘I never have beheld one in this country before!’ And raising his gun, he aimed just behind the ear.
The buffalo gave a leap into the air, and then fell dead.
‘It was a good shot,’ said the young man. And he ran to the village to tell them that the thief was punished.
When he entered his hut he found his wife, who had somehow heard the news, twisting herself to and fro and shedding tears.
‘Are you ill?’ asked he. And she answered: ‘Yes; I have pains all over my body.’ But she was not ill at all, only very unhappy at the death of the buffalo which had served her so well. Her husband felt anxious, and sent for the medicine man; but though she pretended to listen to him, she threw all his medicine out of the door directly he had gone away.
With the first rays of light the whole village was awake, and the women set forth armed with baskets and the men with knives in order to cut up the buffalo. Only the girl remained in her hut; and after a while she too went to join them, groaning and weeping as she walked along.
‘What are you doing here?’ asked her husband when he saw her. ‘If you are ill you are better at home.’
‘Oh! I could not stay alone in the village,’ said she. And her mother-in-law left off her work to come and scold her, and to tell her that she would kill herself if she did such foolish things. But the girl would not listen and sat down and looked on.
When they had divided the buffalo’s flesh, and each woman had the family portion in her basket, the stranger wife got up and said:
‘Let me have the head.’
‘You could never carry anything so heavy,’ answered the men, ‘and now you are ill besides.’
‘You do not know how strong I am,’ answered she. And at last they gave it her.
She did not walk to the village with the others, but lingered behind, and, instead of entering her hut, she slipped into the little shed where the pots for cooking and storing maize were kept. Then she laid down the buffalo’s head and sat beside it. Her husband came to seek her, and begged her to leave the shed and go to bed, as she must be tired out; but the girl would not stir, neither would she attend to the words of her mother-in-law.
‘I wish you would leave me alone!’ she answered crossly. ‘It is impossible to sleep if somebody is always coming in.’ And she turned her back on them, and would not even eat the food they had brought. So they went away, and the young man soon stretched himself out on his mat; but his wife’s odd conduct made him anxious, and he lay wake all night, listening.
When all was still the girl made a fire and boiled some water in a pot. As soon as it was quite hot she shook in the medicine that she had brought from home, and then, taking the buffalo’s head, she made incisions with her little knife behind the ear, and close to the temple where the shot had struck him. Next she applied the horn to the spot and blew with all her force till, at length, the blood began to move. After that she spread some of the deer fat out of the calabash over the wound, which she held in the steam of the hot water. Last of all, she sang in a low voice a dirge over the Rover of the Plain.
As she chanted the final words the head moved, and the limbs came back. The buffalo began to feel alive again and shook his horns, and stood up and stretched himself. Unluckily it was just at this moment that the husband said to himself:
‘I wonder if she is crying still, and what is the matter with her! Perhaps I had better go and see.’ And he got up and, calling her by name, went out to the shed.
‘Go away! I don’t want you!’ she cried angrily. But it was too late. The buffalo had fallen to the ground, dead, and with the wound in his head as before.
The young man who, unlike most of his tribe, was afraid of his wife, returned to his bed without having seen anything, but wondering very much what she could be doing all this time. After waiting a few minutes, she began her task over again, and at the end the buffalo stood on his feet as before. But just as the girl was rejoicing that her work was completed, in came the husband once more to see what his wife was doing; and this time he sat himself down in the hut, and said that he wished to watch whatever was going on. Then the girl took up the pitcher and all her other things and left the shed, trying for the third time to bring the buffalo back to life.
She was too late; the dawn was already breaking, and the head fell to the ground, dead and corrupt as it was before.
The girl entered the hut, where her husband and his mother were getting ready to go out.
‘I want to go down to the lake, and bathe,’ said she.
‘But you could never walk so far,’ answered they. ‘You are so tired, as it is, that you can hardly stand!’
However, in spite of their warnings, the girl left the hut in the direction of the lake. Very soon she came back weeping, and sobbed out:
‘I met some one in the village who lives in my country, and he told me that my mother is very, very ill, and if I do not go to her at once she will be dead before I arrive. I will return as soon as I can, and now farewell.’ And she set forth in the direction of the mountains. But this story was not true; she knew nothing about her mother, only she wanted an excuse to go home and tell her family that their prophecies had come true, and that the buffalo was dead.
Balancing her basket on her head, she walked along, and directly she had left the village behind her she broke out into the song of the Rover of the Plain, and at last, at the end of the day, she came to the group of huts where her parents lived. Her friends all ran to meet her, and, weeping, she told them that the buffalo was dead.
This sad news spread like lightning through the country, and the people flocked from far and near to bewail the loss of the beast who had been their pride.
‘If you had only listened to us,’ they cried, ‘he would be alive now. But you refused all the little girls we offered you, and would have nothing but the buffalo. And remember what the medicine-man said: “If the buffalo dies you die also!”‘
So they bewailed their fate, one to the other, and for a while they did not perceive that the girl’s husband was sitting in their midst, leaning his gun against a tree. Then one man, turning, beheld him, and bowed mockingly.
‘Hail, murderer! hail! you have slain us all!’
The young man stared, not knowing what he meant, and answered, wonderingly:
‘I shot a buffalo; is that why you call me a murderer?’
‘A buffalo–yes; but the servant of your wife! It was he who carried the wood and drew the water. Did you not know it?’
‘No; I did not know it,’ replied the husband in surprise. ‘Why did no one tell me? Of course I should not have shot him!’
‘Well, he is dead,’ answered they, ‘and we must die too.’
At this the girl took a cup in which some poisonous herbs had been crushed, and holding it in her hands, she wailed: ‘O my father, Rover of the Plain!’ Then drinking a deep draught from it, fell back dead. One by one her parents, her brothers and her sisters, drank also and died, singing a dirge to the memory of the buffalo.
The girl’s husband looked on with horror; and returned sadly home across the mountains, and, entering his hut, threw himself on the ground. At first he was too tired to speak; but at length he raised his head and told all the story to his father and mother, who sat watching him. When he had finished they shook their heads and said:
‘Now you see that we spoke no idle words when we told you that ill would come of your marriage! We offered you a good and hard- working wife, and you would have none of her. And it is not only your wife you have lost, but your fortune also. For who will give you back your money if they are all dead?’
‘It is true, O my father,’ answered the young man. But in his heart he thought more of the loss of his wife than of the money he had given for her.

In the great country far away south, through which flows the river Nile, there lived a king who had an only child called Samba.
Now, from the time that Samba could walk he showed signs of being afraid of everything, and as he grew bigger he became more and more frightened. At first his father’s friends made light of it, and said to each other:
‘It is strange to see a boy of our race running into a hut at the trumpeting of an elephant, and trembling with fear if a lion cub half his size comes near him; but, after all, he is only a baby, and when he is older he will be as brave as the rest.’
‘Yes, he is only a baby,’ answered the king who overheard them, ‘it will be all right by-and-by.’ But, somehow, he sighed as he said it, and the men looked at him and made no reply.
The years passed away, and Samba had become a tall and strong youth. He was good-natured and pleasant, and was liked by all, and if during his father’s hunting parties he was seldom to be seen in any place of danger, he was too great a favourite for much to be said.
‘When the king holds the feast and declares him to be his heir, he will cease to be a child,’ murmured the rest of the people, as they had done before; and on the day of the ceremony their hearts beat gladly, and they cried to each other:
‘It is Samba, Samba, whose chin is above the heads of other men, who will defend us against the tribes of the robbers !’
Not many weeks after, the dwellers in the village awoke to find that during the night their herds had been driven away, and their herdsmen carried off into slavery by their enemies. Now was the time for Samba to show the brave spirit that had come to him with his manhood, and to ride forth at the head of the warriors of his race. But Samba could nowhere be found, and a party of the avengers went on their way without him.
It was many days later before he came back, with his head held high, and a tale of a lion which he had tracked to its lair and killed, at the risk of his own life. A little while earlier and his people would have welcomed his story, and believed it all, but now it was too late.
‘Samba the Coward,’ cried a voice from the crowd; and the name stuck to him, even the very children shouted it at him, and his father did not spare him. At length he could bear it no longer, and made up his mind to leave his own land for another where peace had reigned since the memory of man. So, early next morning, he slipped out to the king’s stables, and choosing the quietest horse he could find, he rode away northwards.
Never as long as he lived did Samba forget the terrors of that journey. He could hardly sleep at night for dread of the wild beasts that might be lurking behind every rock or bush, while, by day, the distant roar of a lion would cause him to start so violently, that he almost fell from his horse. A dozen times he was on the point of turning back, and it was not the terror of the mocking words and scornful laughs that kept him from doing so, but the terror lest he should be forced to take part in their wars. Therefore he held on, and deeply thankful he felt when the walls of a city, larger than he had ever dreamed of, rose before him.
Drawing himself up to his full height, he rode proudly through the gate and past the palace, where, as was her custom, the princess was sitting on the terrace roof, watching the bustle in the street below.
‘That is a gallant figure,’ thought she, as Samba, mounted on his big black horse, steered his way skilfully among the crowds; and, beckoning to a slave, she ordered him to go and meet the stranger, and ask him who he was and whence he came.
‘Oh, princess, he is the son of a king, and heir to a country which lies near the Great River,’ answered the slave, when he had returned from questioning Samba. And the princess on hearing this news summoned her father, and told him that if she was not allowed to wed the stranger she would die unmarried.
Like many other fathers, the king could refuse his daughter nothing, and besides, she had rejected so many suitors already that he was quite alarmed lest no man should be good enough for her. Therefore, after a talk with Samba, who charmed him by his good humour and pleasant ways, he gave his consent, and three days later the wedding feast was celebrated with the utmost splendour.
The princess was very proud of her tall handsome husband, and for some time she was quite content that he should pass the days with her under the palm trees, telling her the stories that she loved, or amusing her with tales of the manners and customs of his country, which were so different to those of her own. But, by-and-by, this was not enough; she wanted other people to be proud of him too, and one day she said:
‘I really almost wish that those Moorish thieves from the north would come on one of their robbing expeditions. I should love so to see you ride out at the head of our men, to chase them home again. Ah, how happy I should be when the city rang with your noble deeds !’
She looked lovingly at him as she spoke; but to her surprise, his face grew dark, and he answered hastily:
‘Never speak to me again of the Moors or of war. It was to escape from them that I fled from my own land, and at the first word of invasion I should leave you for ever.’
‘How funny you are,’ cried she, breaking into a laugh. ‘The idea of anyone as big as you being afraid of a Moor! But still, you mustn’t say those things to anyone except me, or they might think you were in earnest.’
Not very long after this, when the people of the city were holding a great feast outside the walls of the town, a body of Moors, who had been in hiding for days, drove off all the sheep and goats which were peacefully feeding on the slopes of a hill. Directly the loss was discovered, which was not for some hours, the king gave orders that the war drum should be beaten, and the warriors assembled in the great square before the palace, trembling with fury at the insult which had been put upon them. Loud were the cries for instant vengeance, and for Samba, son-in-law of the king, to lead them to battle. But shout as they might, Samba never came.
And where was he ? No further than in a cool, dark cellar of the palace, crouching among huge earthenware pots of grain. With a rush of pain at her heart, there his wife found him, and she tried with all her strength to kindle in him a sense of shame, but in vain. Even the thought of the future danger he might run from the contempt of his subjects was as nothing when compared with the risks of the present.
‘Take off your tunic of mail,’ said the princess at last; and her voice was so stern and cold that none would have known it. ‘Give it to me, and hand me besides your helmet, your sword and spear.’ And with many fearful glances to right and to left, Samba stripped off the armour inlaid with gold, the property of the king’s son-in-law. Silently his wife took, one by one, the pieces from him, and fastened them on her with firm hands, never even glancing at the tall form of her husband who had slunk back to his corner. When she had fastened the last buckle, and lowered her vizor, she went out, and mounting Samba’s horse, gave the signal to the warriors to follow.
Now, although the princess was much shorter than her husband, she was a tall woman, and the horse which she rode was likewise higher than the rest, so that when the men caught sight of the gold-inlaid suit of chain armour, they did not doubt that Samba was taking his rightful place, and cheered him loudly. The princess bowed in answer to their greeting, but kept her vizor down; and touching her horse with the spur, she galloped at the head of her troops to charge the enemy. The Moors, who had not expected to be so quickly pursued, had scarcely time to form themselves into battle array, and were speedily put to flight. Then the little troop of horsemen returned to the city, where all sung the praises of Samba their leader.
The instant they reached the palace the princess flung her reins to a groom, and disappeared up a side staircase, by which she could, unseen, enter her own rooms. Here she found Samba lying idly on a heap of mats; but he raised his head uneasily as the door opened and looked at his wife, not feeling sure how she might act towards him. However, he need not have been afraid of harsh words: she merely unbuttoned her armour as fast as possible, and bade him put it on with all speed. Samba obeyed, not daring to ask any questions; and when he had finished the princess told him to follow her, and led him on to the flat roof of the house, below which a crowd had gathered, cheering lustily.
‘Samba, the king’s son-in-law ! Samba, the bravest, of the brave ! Where is he ? Let him show himself ! And when Samba did show himself the shouts and applause became louder than ever. ‘See how modest he is ! He leaves the glory to others !’ cried they. And Samba only smiled and waved his hand, and said nothing.
Out of all the mass of people assembled there to do honour to Samba, one alone there was who did not shout and praise with the rest. This was the princess’s youngest brother, whose sharp eyes had noted certain things during the fight which recalled his sister much more than they did her husband. Under promise of secrecy, he told his suspicions to the other princes, but only got laughed at, and was bidden to carry his dreams elsewhere.
‘Well, well,’ answered the boy, ‘we shall see who is right; but the next time we give battle to the Moors I will take care to place a private mark on our commander.’
In spite of their defeat, not many days after the Moors sent a fresh body of troops to steal some cattle, and again Samba’s wife dressed herself in her husband’s armour, and rode out at the head of the avenging column. This time the combat was fiercer than before, and in the thick of it her youngest brother drew near, and gave his sister a slight wound on the leg. At the moment she paid no heed to the pain, which, indeed, she scarcely felt; but when the enemy had been put to flight and the little band returned to the palace, faintness suddenly overtook her, and she could hardly stagger up the staircase to her own apartments.
‘I am wounded,’ she cried, sinking down on the mats where he had been lying, ‘but do not be anxious; it is really nothing. You have only got to wound yourself slightly in the same spot and no one will guess that it was I and not you who were fighting.’
‘What !’ cried Samba, his eyes nearly starting from his head in surprise and terror. ‘Can you possibly imagine that I should agree to anything so useless and painful ? Why, I might as well have gone to fight myself !’
‘Ah, I ought to have known better, indeed,’ answered the princess, in a voice that seemed to come from a long way off; but, quick as thought, the moment Samba turned his back she pierced one of his bare legs with a spear.
He gave a loud scream and staggered backwards, from astonishment, much more than from pain. But before he could speak his wife had left the room and had gone to seek the medicine man of the palace.
‘My husband has been wounded,’ said she, when she had found him, ‘come and tend him with speed, for he is faint from loss of blood.’ And she took care that more than one person heard her words, so that all that day the people pressed up to the gate of the palace, asking for news of their brave champion.
‘You see,’ observed the king’s eldest sons, who had visited the room where Samba lay groaning, ‘you see, O, wise young brother, that we were right and you were wrong about Samba, and that he really did go into the battle.’ But the boy answered nothing, and only shook his head doubtfully.
It was only two days later that the Moors appeared for the third time, and though the herds had been tethered in a new and safer place, they were promptly carried off as before. ‘For,’ said the Moors to each other, ‘the tribe will never think of our coming back so soon when they have beaten us so badly.’
When the drum sounded to assemble all the fighting men, the princess rose and sought her husband.
‘Samba,’ cried she, ‘my wound is worse than I thought. I can scarcely walk, and could not mount my horse without help. For to-day, then, I cannot do your work, so you must go instead of me.’
‘What nonsense,’ exclaimed Samba, ‘I never heard of such a thing. Why, I might be wounded, or even killed ! You have three brothers. The king can choose one of them.’
‘They are all too young,’ replied his wife; ‘the men would not obey them. But if, indeed, you will not go, at least you can help me to harness my horse.’ And to this Samba, who was always ready to do anything he was asked when there was no danger about it, agreed readily.
So the horse was quickly harnessed, and when it was done the princess said:
Now ride the horse to the place of meeting outside the gates, and I will join you by a shorter way, and will change places with you.’ Samba, who loved riding in times of peace, mounted as she had told him, and when he was safe in the saddle, his wife dealt the horse a sharp cut with her whip, and he dashed off through the town and through the ranks of the warriors who were waiting for him. Instantly the whole place was in motion. Samba tried to check his steed, but he might as well have sought to stop the wind, and it seemed no more than a few minutes before they were grappling hand to hand with the Moors.
Then a miracle happened. Samba the coward, the skulker, the terrified, no sooner found himself pressed hard, unable to escape, than something sprang into life within him, and he fought with all his might. And when a man of his size and strength begins to fight he generally fights well.
That day the victory was really owing to Samba, and the shouts of the people were louder than ever. When he returned, bearing with him the sword of the Moorish chief, the old king pressed him in his arms and said:
‘Oh, my son, how can I ever show you how grateful I am for this splendid service.’
But Samba, who was good and loyal when fear did not possess him, answered straightly:
‘My father, it is to your daughter and not to me to whom thanks are due, for it is she who has turned the coward that I was into a brave man.’

In a certain town there lived a judge who was married but had no children. One day he was standing lost in thought before his house, when an old man passed by.
‘What is the matter, sir, said he, ‘you look troubled?’
‘Oh, leave me alone, my good man!’
‘But what is it?’ persisted the other.
‘Well, I am successful in my profession and a person of importance, but I care nothing for it all, as I have no children.’
Then the old man said, ‘Here are twelve apples. If your wife eats them, she will have twelve sons.’
The judge thanked him joyfully as he took the apples, and went to seek his wife. ‘Eat these apples at once,’ he cried, ‘and you will have twelve sons.’
So she sat down and ate eleven of them, but just as she was in the middle of the twelfth her sister came in, and she gave her the half that was left.
The eleven sons came into the world, strong and handsome boys; but when the twelfth was born, there was only half of him.
By-and-by they all grew into men, and one day they told their father it was high time he found wives for them. ‘I have a brother,’ he answered, ‘who lives away in the East, and he has twelve daughters; go and marry them.’ So the twelve sons saddled their horses and rode for twelve days, till they met an old woman.
‘Good greeting to you, young men!’ said she, ‘we have waited long for you, your uncle and I. The girls have become women, and are sought, in marriage by many, but I knew you would come one day, and I have kept them for you. Follow me into my house.’
And the twelve brothers followed her gladly, and their father’s brother stood at the door, and gave them meat and drink. But at night, when every one was asleep, Halfman crept softly to his brothers, and said to them, ‘Listen, all of you! This man is no uncle of ours, but an ogre.’
‘Nonsense; of course he is our uncle,’ answered they.
‘Well, this very night you will see!’ said Halfman. And he did not go to bed, but hid himself and watched.
Now in a little while he saw the wife of the ogre steal into the room on tiptoe and spread a red cloth over the brothers and then go and cover her daughters with a white cloth. After that she lay down and was soon snoring loudly. When Halfman was quite sure she was sound asleep, he took the red cloth from his brothers and put it on the girls, and laid their white cloth over his brothers. Next he drew their scarlet caps from their heads and exchanged them for the veils which the ogre’s daughters were wearing. This was hardly done when he heard steps coming along the floor, so he hid himself quickly in the folds of a curtain. There was only half of him!
The ogress came slowly and gently along, stretching out her hands before her, so that she might not fall against anything unawares, for she had only a tiny lantern slung at her waist, which did not give much light. And when she reached the place where the sisters were lying, she stooped down and held a corner of the cloth up to the lantern. Yes! it certainly was red! Still, to make sure that there was no mistake, she passed her hands lightly over their heads, and felt the caps that covered them. Then she was quite certain the brothers lay sleeping before her, and began to kill them one by one. And Halfman whispered to his brothers, ‘Get up and run for your lives, as the ogress is killing her daughters.’ The brothers needed no second bidding, and in a moment were out of the house.
By this time the ogress had slain all her daughters but one, who awoke suddenly and saw what had happened. ‘Mother, what are you doing?’ cried she. ‘Do you know that you have killed my sisters?’
‘Oh, woe is me!’ wailed the ogress. ‘Halfman has outwitted me after all!’ And she turned to wreak vengeance on him, but he and his brothers were far away.
They rode all day till they got to the town where their real uncle lived, and inquired the way to his house.
‘Why have you been so long in coming?’ asked he, when they had found him.
‘Oh, dear uncle, we were very nearly not coming at all!’ replied they. ‘We fell in with an ogress who took us home and would have killed us if it had not been for Halfman. He knew what was in her mind and saved us, and here we are. Now give us each a daughter to wife, and let us return whence we came.’
‘Take them!’ said the uncle; ‘the eldest for the eldest, the second for the second, and so on to the youngest.’
But the wife of Halfman was the prettiest of them all, and the other brothers were jealous and said to each other: ‘What, is he who is only half a man to get the best? Let us put him to death and give his wife to our eldest brother!’ And they waited for a chance.
After they had all ridden, in company with their brides, for some distance, they arrived at a brook, and one of them asked, ‘Now, who will go and fetch water from the brook?’
‘Halfman is the youngest,’ said the elder brother, ‘he must go.’
So Halfman got down and filled a skin with water, and they drew it up by a rope and drank. When they had done drinking, Halfman, who was standing in the middle of the stream, called out: ‘Throw me the rope and draw me up, for I cannot get out alone.’ And the brothers threw him a rope to draw him up the steep bank; but when he was half-way up they cut the rope, and he fell back into the stream. Then the brothers rode away as fast as they could, with his bride.
Halfman sank down under the water from the force of the fall, but before he touched the bottom a fish came and said to him, ‘Fear nothing, Halfman; I will help you.’ And the fish guided him to a shallow place, so that he scrambled out. On the way it said to him, ‘Do you understand what your brothers, whom you saved from death, have done to you?’
‘Yes; but what am I to do?’ asked Halfman.
‘Take one of my scales,’ said the fish, ‘and when you find yourself in danger, throw it in the fire. Then I will appear before you.’
‘Thank you,’ said Halfman, and went his way, while the fish swam back to its home.
The country was strange to Halfman, and he wandered about without knowing where he was going, till he suddenly found the ogress standing before him. ‘Ah, Halfman, have I got you at last? You killed my daughters and helped your brothers to escape. What do you think I shall do with you?’
‘Whatever you like!’ said Halfman.
‘Come into my house, then,’ said the ogress, and he followed her.
‘Look here!’ she called to her husband, ‘I have got hold of Halfman. I am going to roast him, so be quick and make up the fire!’
So the ogre brought wood, and heaped it up till the flames roared up the chimney. Then he turned to his wife and said: ‘It is all ready, let us put him on!’
‘What is the hurry, my good ogre?’ asked Halfman. ‘You have me in your power, and I cannot escape. I am so thin now, I shall hardly make one mouthful. Better fatten me up; you will enjoy me much more.’
‘That is a very sensible remark,’ replied the ogre; ‘but what fattens you quickest?’
‘Butter, meat, and red wine,’ answered Halfman.
‘Very good; we will lock you into this room, and here you shall stay till you are ready for eating.’
So Halfman was locked into the room, and the ogre and his wife brought him his food. At the end of three months he said to his gaolers: ‘Now I have got quite fat; take me out, and kill me.’
‘Get out, then!’ said the ogre.
‘But,’ went on Halfman, ‘you and your wife had better go to invite your friends to the feast, and your daughter can stay in the house and look after me!’
‘Yes, that is a good idea,’ answered they.
‘You had better bring the wood in here,’ continued Halfman, ‘and I will split it up small, so that there may be no delay in cooking me.’
So the ogress gave Halfman a pile of wood and an axe, and then set out with her husband, leaving Halfman and her daughter busy in the house.
After he had chopped for a little while he called to the girl, ‘Come and help me, or else I shan’t have it all ready when your mother gets back.’
‘All right,’ said she, and held a billet of wood for him to chop.
But he raised his axe and cut off her head, and ran away like the wind. By-and-by the ogre and his wife returned and found their daughter lying without her head, and they began to cry and sob, saying, ‘This is Halfman’s work, why did we listen to him?’ But Halfman was far away.
When he escaped from the house he ran on straight before him for some time, looking for a safe shelter, as he knew that the ogre’s legs were much longer than his, and that it was his only chance. At last he saw an iron tower which he climbed up. Soon the ogre appeared, looking right and left lest his prey should be sheltering behind a rock or tree, but he did not know Halfman was so near till he heard his voice calling, ‘Come up! come up! you will find me here!’
‘But how can I come up?’ said the ogre, ‘I see no door, and I could not possibly climb that tower.’
‘Oh, there is no door,’ replied Halfman.
‘Then how did you climb up?’
‘A fish carried me on his back.’
‘And what am I to do?’
‘You must go and fetch all your relations, and tell them to bring plenty of sticks; then you must light a fire, and let it burn till the tower becomes red hot. After that you can easily throw it down.’
‘Very good,’ said the ogre, and he went round to every relation he had, and told them to collect wood and bring it to the tower where Halfman was. The men did as they were ordered, and soon the tower was glowing like coral, but when they flung themselves against it to overthrow it, they caught themselves on fire and were burnt to death. And overhead sat Halfman, laughing heartily. But the ogre’s wife was still alive, for she had taken no part in kindling the fire.
‘Oh,’ she shrieked with rage, ‘you have killed my daughters and my husband, and all the men belonging to me; how can I get at you to avenge myself?’
‘Oh, that is easy enough,’ said Halfman. ‘I will let down a rope, and if you tie it tightly round you, I will draw it up.’
‘All right,’ returned the ogress, fastening the rope which Halfman let down. ‘Now pull me up.’
‘Are you sure it is secure?’
‘Yes, quite sure.’
‘Don’t be afraid.’
‘Oh, I am not afraid at all!’
So Halfman slowly drew her up, and when she was near the top he let go the rope, and she fell down and broke her neck. Then Halfman heaved a great sigh and said, ‘That was hard work; the rope has hurt my hands badly, but now I am rid of her for ever.’
So Halfman came down from the tower, and went on, till he got to a desert place, and as he was very tired, he lay down to sleep. While it was still dark, an ogress passed by, and she woke him and said, ‘Halfman, to-morrow your brother is to marry your wife.’
‘Oh, how can I stop it?’ asked he. ‘Will you help me?’
‘Yes, I will,’ replied the ogress.
‘Thank you, thank you!’ cried Halfman, kissing her on the forehead. ‘My wife is dearer to me than anything else in the world, and it is not my brother’s fault that I am not dead long ago.’
‘Very well, I will rid you of him,’ said the ogress, ‘but only on one condition. If a boy is born to you, you must give him to me!’
‘Oh, anything,’ answered Halfman, ‘as long as you deliver me from my brother, and get me my wife.’
‘Mount on my back, then, and in a quarter of an hour we shall be there.’
The ogress was as good as her word, and in a few minutes they arrived at the outskirts of the town where Halfman and his brothers lived. Here she left him, while she went into the town itself, and found the wedding guests just leaving the brother’s house. Unnoticed by anyone, the ogress crept into a curtain, changing herself into a scorpion, and when the brother was going to get into bed, she stung him behind the ear, so that he fell dead where he stood. Then she returned to Halfman and told him to go and claim his bride. He jumped up hastily from his seat, and took the road to his father’s house. As he drew near he heard sounds of weeping and lamentations, and he said to a man he met: ‘What is the matter?’
‘The judge’s eldest son was married yesterday, and died suddenly before night.’
‘Well,’ thought Halfman, ‘my conscience is clear anyway, for it is quite plain he coveted my wife, and that is why he tried to drown me.’ He went at once to his father’s room, and found him sitting in tears on the floor. ‘Dear father,’ said Halfman, ‘are you not glad to see me? You weep for my brother, but I am your son too, and he stole my bride from me and tried to drown me in the brook. If he is dead, I at least am alive.’
‘No, no, he was better than you!’ moaned the father.
‘Why, dear father?’
‘He told me you had behaved very ill,’ said he.
‘Well, call my brothers,’ answered Halfman, ‘as I have a story to tell them.’ So the father called them all into his presence. Then Halfman began: ‘After we were twelve days’ journey from home, we met an ogress, who gave us greeting and said, “Why have you been so long coming? The daughters of your uncle have waited for you in vain,” and she bade us follow her to the house, saying, “Now there need be no more delay; you can marry your cousins as soon as you please, and take them with you to your own home.” But I warned my brothers that the man was not our uncle, but an ogre.
‘When we lay down to sleep, she spread a red cloth over us, and covered her daughters with a white one; but I changed the cloths, and when the ogress came back in the middle of the night, and looked at the cloths, she mistook her own daughters for my brothers, and killed them one by one, all but the youngest. Then I woke my brothers, and we all stole softly from the house, and we rode like the wind to our real uncle.
‘And when he saw us, he bade us welcome, and married us to his twelve daughters, the eldest to the eldest, and so on to me, whose bride was the youngest of all and also the prettiest. And my brothers were filled with envy, and left me to drown in a brook, but I was saved by a fish who showed me how to get out. Now, you are a judge! Who did well, and who did evil–I or my brothers?’
‘Is this story true?’ said the father, turning to his sons.
‘It is true, my father,’ answered they. ‘It is even as Halfman has said, and the girl belongs to him.’
Then the judge embraced Halfman and said to him: ‘You have done well, my son. Take your bride, and may you both live long and happily together!’
At the end of the year Halfman’s wife had a son, and not long after she came one day hastily into the room. and found her husband weeping. ‘What is the matter?’ she asked.
‘The matter?’ said he.
‘Yes, why are you weeping?’
‘Because,’ replied Halfman, ‘the baby is not really ours, but belongs to an ogress.’
‘Are you mad?’ cried the wife. ‘What do you mean by talking like that?’
‘I promised,’ said Halfman, ‘when she undertook to kill my brother and to give you to me, that the first son we had should be hers.’
‘And will she take him from us now?’ said the poor woman.
‘No, not quite yet,’ replied Halfman; ‘when he is bigger.’
‘And is she to have all our children?’ asked she.
‘No, only this one,’ returned Halfman.
Day by day the boy grew bigger, and one day as he was playing in the street with the other children, the ogress came by. ‘Go to your father,’ she said, ‘and repeat this speech to him: “I want my forfeit; when am I to have it?” ‘
‘All right,’ replied the child, but when he went home forgot all about it. The next day the ogress came again, and asked the boy what answer the father had given. ‘I forgot all about it,’ said he.
‘Well, put this ring on your finger, and then you won’t forget.’
‘Very well,’ replied the boy, and went home.
The next morning, as he was at breakfast, his mother said to him, ‘Child, where did you get that ring?’
‘A woman gave it to me yesterday, and she told me, father, to tell you that she wanted her forfeit, and when was she to have it?’
Then his father burst into tears and said, ‘If she comes again you must say to her that your parents bid her take her forfeit at once, and depart.’
At this they both began to weep afresh, and his mother kissed him, and put on his new clothes and said, ‘If the woman bids you to follow her, you must go,’ but the boy did not heed her grief, he was so pleased with his new clothes. And when he went out, he said to his play-fellows, ‘Look how smart I am; I am going away with my aunt to foreign lands.’
At that moment the ogress came up and asked him, ‘Did you give my message to your father and mother?’
‘Yes, dear aunt, I did.’
‘And what did they say?’
‘Take it away at once!’
So she took him.
But when dinner-time came, and the boy did not return, his father and mother knew that he would never come back, and they sat down and wept all day. At last Halfman rose up and said to his wife, ‘Be comforted; we will wait a year, and then I will go to the ogress and see the boy, and how he is cared for.’
‘Yes, that will be the best,’ said she.
The year passed away, then Halfman saddled his horse, and rode to the place where the ogress had found him sleeping. She was not there, but not knowing what to do next, he got off his horse and waited. About midnight she suddenly stood before him.
‘Halfman, why did you come here?’ said she.
‘I have a question I want to ask you.’
‘Well, ask it; but I know quite well what it is. Your wife wishes you to ask whether I shall carry off your second son as I did the first.’
‘Yes, that is it,’ replied Halfman. Then he seized her hand and said, ‘Oh, let me see my son, and how he looks, and what he is doing.’
The ogress was silent, but stuck her staff hard in the earth, and the earth opened, and the boy appeared and said, ‘Dear father, have you come too?’ And his father clasped him in his arms, and began to cry. But the boy struggled to be free, saying ‘Dear father, put me down. I have got a new mother, who is better than the old one; and a new father, who is better than you.’
Then his father sat him down and said, ‘Go in peace, my boy, but listen first to me. Tell your father the ogre and your mother the ogress, that never more shall they have any children of mine.’
‘All right,’ replied the boy, and called ‘Mother!’
‘What is it?’
‘You are never to take away any more of my father and mother’s children!’
‘Now that I have got you, I don’t want any more,’ answered she.
Then the boy turned to his father and said, ‘Go in peace, dear father, and give my mother greeting and tell her not to be anxious any more, for she can keep all her children.’
And Halfman mounted his horse and rode home, and told his wife all he had seen, and the message sent by Mohammed–Mohammed the son of Halfman, the son of the judge.

Once upon a time there lived a poor woman who had only one child, and he was a little boy called Hassebu. When he ceased to be a baby, and his mother thought it was time for him to learn to read, she sent him to school. And, after he had done with school, he was put into a shop to learn how to make clothes, and did not learn; and he was put to do silversmith’s work, and did not learn; and whatsoever he was taught, he did not learn it. His mother never wished him to do anything he did not like, so she said: ‘Well, stay at home, my son.’ And he stayed at home, eating and sleeping.
One day the boy said to his mother: ‘What was my father’s business?’
‘He was a very learned doctor,’ answered she.
‘Where, then, are his books?’ asked Hassebu.
‘Many days have passed, and I have thought nothing of them. But look inside and see if they are there.’ So Hassebu looked, and saw they were eaten by insects, all but one book, which he took away and read.
He was sitting at home one morning poring over the medicine book, when some neighbours came by and said to his mother: ‘Give us this boy, that we may go together to cut wood.’ For wood-cutting was their trade, and they loaded several donkeys with the wood, and sold it in the town.
And his mother answered, ‘Very well; to-morrow I will buy him a donkey, and you can all go together.’
So the donkey was bought, and the neighbours came, and they worked hard all day, and in the evening they brought the wood back into the town, and sold it for a good sum of money. And for six days they went and did the like, but on the seventh it rained, and the wood-cutters ran and hid in the rocks, all but Hassebu, who did not mind wetting, and stayed where he was.
While he was sitting in the place where the wood-cutters had left him, he took up a stone that lay near him, and idly dropped it on the ground. It rang with a hollow sound, and he called to his companions, and said, ‘Come here and listen; the ground seems hollow!’
‘Knock again!’ cried they. And he knocked and listened.
‘Let us dig,’ said the boy. And they dug, and found a large pit like a well, filled with honey up to the brim.
‘This is better than firewood,’ said they; ‘it will bring us more money. And as you have found it, Hassebu, it is you who must go inside and dip out the honey and give to us, and we will take it to the town and sell it, and will divide the money with you.’
The following day each man brought every bowl and vessel he could find at home, and Hassebu filled them all with honey. And this he did every day for three months.
At the end of that time the honey was very nearly finished, and there was only a little left, quite at the bottom, and that was very deep down, so deep that it seemed as if it must be right in the middle of the earth. Seeing this, the men said to Hassebu, ‘We will put a rope under your arms, and let you down, so that you may scrape up all the honey that is left, and when you have done we will lower the rope again, and you shall make it fast, and we will draw you up.’
‘Very well,’ answered the boy, and he went down, and he scraped and scraped till there was not so much honey left as would cover the point of a needle. ‘Now I am ready!’ he cried; but they consulted together and said, ‘Let us leave him there inside the pit, and take his share of the money, and we will tell his mother, “Your son was caught by a lion and carried off into the forest, and we tried to follow him, but could not.” ‘
Then they arose and went into the town and told his mother as they had agreed, and she wept much and made her mourning for many months. And when the men were dividing the money, one said, ‘Let us send a little to our friend’s mother,’ and they sent some to her; and every day one took her rice, and one oil; one took her meat, and one took her cloth, every day.
It did not take long for Hassebu to find out that his companions had left him to die in the pit, but he had a brave heart, and hoped that he might be able to find a way out for himself. So he at once began to explore the pit and found it ran back a long way underground. And by night he slept, and by day he took a little of the honey he had gathered and ate it; and so many days passed by.
One morning, while he was sitting on a rock having his breakfast, a large scorpion dropped down at his feet, and he took a stone and killed it, fearing it would sting him. Then suddenly the thought darted into his head, ‘This scorpion must have come from somewhere! Perhaps there is a hole. I will go and look for it,’ and he felt all round the walls of the pit till he found a very little hole in the roof of the pit, with a tiny glimmer of light at the far end of it. Then his heart felt glad, and he took out his knife and dug and dug, till the little hole became a big one, and he could wriggle himself through. And when he had got outside, he saw a large open space in front of him, and a path leading out of it.
He went along the path, on and on, till he reached a large house, with a golden door standing open. Inside was a great hall, and in the middle of the hall a throne set with precious stones and a sofa spread with the softest cushions. And he went in and lay down on it, and fell fast asleep, for he had wandered far.
By-and-by there was a sound of people coming through the courtyard, and the measured tramp of soldiers. This was the King of the Snakes coming in state to his palace.
They entered the hall, but all stopped in surprise at finding a man lying on the king’s own bed. The soldiers wished to kill him at once, but the king said, ‘Leave him alone, put me on a chair,’ and the soldiers who were carrying him knelt on the floor, and he slid from their shoulders on to a chair. When he was comfortably seated, he turned to his soldiers, and bade them wake the stranger gently. And they woke him, and he sat up and saw many snakes all round him, and one of them very beautiful, decked in royal robes.
‘Who are you?’ asked Hassebu.
‘I am the King of the Snakes,’ was the reply, ‘and this is my palace. And will you tell me who you are, and where you come from?’
‘My name is Hassebu, but whence I come I know not, nor whither I go.’
‘Then stay for a little with me,’ said the king, and he bade his soldiers bring water from the spring and fruits from the forest, and to set them before the guest.
For some days Hassebu rested and feasted in the palace of the King of the Snakes, and then he began to long for his mother and his own country. So he said to the King of the Snakes, ‘Send me home, I pray.’
But the King of the Snakes answered, ‘When you go home, you will do me evil!’
‘I will do you no evil,’ replied Hassebu; ‘send me home, I pray.’
But the king said, ‘I know it. If I send you home, you will come back, and kill me. I dare not do it.’ But Hassebu begged so hard that at last the king said, ‘Swear that when you get home you will not go to bathe where many people are gathered.’ And Hassebu swore, and the king ordered his soldiers to take Hassebu in sight of his native city. Then he went straight to his mother’s house, and the heart of his mother was glad.
Now the Sultan of the city was very ill, and all the wise men said that the only thing to cure him was the flesh of the King of the Snakes, and that the only man who could get it was a man with a strange mark on his chest. So the Vizir had set people to watch at the public baths, to see if such a man came there.
For three days Hassebu remembered his promise to the King of the Snakes, and did not go near the baths; then came a morning so hot he could hardly breathe, and he forgot all about it.
The moment he had slipped off his robe he was taken before the Vizir, who said to him, ‘Lead us to the place where the King of the Snakes lives.’
‘I do not know it!’ answered he, but the Vizir did not believe him, and had him bound and beaten till his back was all torn.
Then Hassebu cried, ‘Loose me, that I may take you.’
They went together a long, long way, till they reached the palace of the King of the Snakes.
And Hassebu said to the King: ‘It was not I: look at my back and you will see how they drove me to it.’
‘Who has beaten you like this?’ asked the King.
‘It was the Vizir,’ replied Hassebu.
‘Then I am already dead,’ said the King sadly, ‘but you must carry me there yourself.’
So Hassebu carried him. And on the way the King said, ‘When I arrive, I shall be killed, and my flesh will be cooked. But take some of the water that I am boiled in, and put it in a bottle and lay it on one side. The Vizir will tell you to drink it, but be careful not to do so. Then take some more of the water, and drink it, and you will become a great physician, and the third supply you will give to the Sultan. And when the Vizir comes to you and asks, “Did you drink what I gave you?” you must answer, “I did, and this is for you,” and he will drink it and die! and your soul will rest.’
And they went their way into the town, and all happened as the King of the Snakes had said.
And the Sultan loved Hassebu, who became a great physician, and cured many sick people. But he was always sorry for the poor King of the Snakes.

Once upon a time there lived a man who wasted all his money, and grew so poor that his only food was a few grains of corn, which he scratched like a fowl from out of a dust-heap.
One day he was scratching as usual among a dust-heap in the street, hoping to find something for breakfast, when his eye fell upon a small silver coin, called an eighth, which he greedily snatched up. ‘Now I can have a proper meal,’ he thought, and after drinking some water at a well he lay down and slept so long that it was sunrise before he woke again. Then he jumped up and returned to the dust-heap. ‘For who knows,’ he said to himself, ‘whether I may not have some good luck again.’
As he was walking down the road, he saw a man coming towards him, carrying a cage made of twigs. ‘Hi! you fellow!’ called he, ‘what have you got inside there?’
‘Gazelles,’ replied the man.
‘Bring them here, for I should like to see them.’
As he spoke, some men who were standing by began to laugh, saying to the man with the cage: ‘You had better take care how you bargain with him, for he has nothing at all except what he picks up from a dust-heap, and if he can’t feed himself, will he be able to feed a gazelle?’
But the man with the cage made answer: ‘Since I started from my home in the country, fifty people at the least have called me to show them my gazelles, and was there one among them who cared to buy? It is the custom for a trader in merchandise to be summoned hither and thither, and who knows where one may find a buyer?’ And he took up his cage and went towards the scratcher of dust-heaps, and the men went with him.
‘What do you ask for your gazelles?’ said the beggar. ‘Will you let me have one for an eighth?’
And the man with the cage took out a gazelle, and held it out, saying, ‘Take this one, master!’
And the beggar took it and carried it to the dust-heap, where he scratched carefully till he found a few grains of corn, which he divided with his gazelle. This he did night and morning, till five days went by.

Then, as he slept, the gazelle woke him, saying, ‘Master.’
And the man answered, ‘How is it that I see a wonder?’
‘What wonder?’ asked the gazelle.
‘Why, that you, a gazelle, should be able to speak, for, from the beginning, my father and mother and all the people that are in the world have never told me of a talking gazelle.’
‘Never mind that,’ said the gazelle, ‘but listen to what I say! First, I took you for my master. Second, you gave for me all you had in the world. I cannot run away from you, but give me, I pray you, leave to go every morning and seek food for myself, and every evening I will come back to you. What you find in the dust-heaps is not enough for both of us.’
‘Go, then,’ answered the master; and the gazelle went.
When the sun had set, the gazelle came back, and the poor man was very glad, and they lay down and slept side by side.
In the morning it said to him, ‘I am going away to feed.’
And the man replied, ‘Go, my son,’ but he felt very lonely without his gazelle, and set out sooner than usual for the dust-heap where he generally found most corn. And glad he was when the evening came, and he could return home. He lay on the grass chewing tobacco, when the gazelle trotted up.
‘Good evening, my master; how have you fared all day? I have been resting in the shade in a place where there is sweet grass when I am hungry, and fresh water when I am thirsty, and a soft breeze to fan me in the heat. It is far away in the forest, and no one knows of it but me, and to-morrow I shall go again.’
So for five days the gazelle set off at daybreak for this cool spot, but on the fifth day it came to a place where the grass was bitter, and it did not like it, and scratched, hoping to tear away the bad blades. But, instead, it saw something lying in the earth, which turned out to be a diamond, very large and bright. ‘Oh, ho!’ said the gazelle to itself, ‘perhaps now I can do something for my master who bought me with all the money he had; but I must be careful or they will say he has stolen it. I had better take it myself to some great rich man, and see what it will do for me.’
Directly the gazelle had come to this conclusion, it picked up the diamond in its mouth, and went on and on and on through the forest, but found no place where a rich man was likely to dwell. For two more days it ran, from dawn to dark, till at last early one morning it caught sight of a large town, which gave it fresh courage.
The people were standing about the streets doing their marketing, when the gazelle bounded past, the diamond flashing as it ran. They called after it, but it took no notice till it reached the palace, where the sultan was sitting, enjoying the cool air. And the gazelle galloped up to him, and laid the diamond at his feet.
The sultan looked first at the diamond and next at the gazelle; then he ordered his attendants to bring cushions and a carpet, that the gazelle might rest itself after its long journey. And he likewise ordered milk to be brought, and rice, that it might eat and drink and be refreshed.
And when the gazelle was rested, the sultan said to it: ‘Give me the news you have come with.’
And the gazelle answered: ‘I am come with this diamond, which is a pledge from my master the Sultan Darai. He has heard you have a daughter, and sends you this small token, and begs you will give her to him to wife.’
And the sultan said: ‘I am content. The wife is his wife, the family is his family, the slave is his slave. Let him come to me empty-handed, I am content.’
When the sultan had ended, the gazelle rose, and said: ‘Master, farewell; I go back to our town, and in eight days, or it may be in eleven days, we shall arrive as your guests.’
And the sultan answered: ‘So let it be.’
All this time the poor man far away had been mourning and weeping for his gazelle, which he thought had run away from him for ever.
And when it came in at the door he rushed to embrace it with such joy that he would not allow it a chance to speak.
‘Be still, master, and don’t cry,’ said the gazelle at last; ‘let us sleep now, and in the morning, when I go, follow me.’
With the first ray of dawn they got up and went into the forest, and on the fifth day, as they were resting near a stream, the gazelle gave its master a sound beating, and then bade him stay where he was till it returned. And the gazelle ran off, and about ten o’clock it came near the sultan’s palace, where the road was all lined with soldiers who were there to do honour to Sultan Darai. And directly they caught sight of the gazelle in the distance one of the soldiers ran on and said, ‘Sultan Darai is coming: I have seen the gazelle.’
Then the sultan rose up, and called his whole court to follow him, and went out to meet the gazelle, who, bounding up to him, gave him greeting. The sultan answered politely, and inquired where it had left its master, whom it had promised to bring back.
‘Alas!’ replied the gazelle, ‘he is lying in the forest, for on our way here we were met by robbers, who, after beating and robbing him, took away all his clothes. And he is now hiding under a bush, lest a passing stranger might see him.’
The sultan, on hearing what had happened to his future son-in-law, turned his horse and rode to the palace, and bade a groom to harness the best horse in the stable and order a woman slave to bring a bag of clothes, such as a man might want, out of the chest; and he chose out a tunic and a turban and a sash for the waist, and fetched himself a gold-hilted sword, and a dagger and a pair of sandals, and a stick of sweet-smelling wood.
‘Now,’ said he to the gazelle, ‘take these things with the soldiers to the sultan, that he may be able to come.’
And the gazelle answered: ‘Can I take those soldiers to go and put my master to shame as he lies there naked? I am enough by myself, my lord.’
‘How will you be enough,’ asked the sultan, ‘to manage this horse and all these clothes?’
‘Oh, that is easily done,’ replied the gazelle. ‘Fasten the horse to my neck and tie the clothes to the back of the horse, and be sure they are fixed firmly, as I shall go faster than he does.’
Everything was carried out as the gazelle had ordered, and when all was ready it said to the sultan: ‘Farewell, my lord, I am going.’
‘Farewell, gazelle,’ answered the sultan; ‘when shall we see you again?’
‘To-morrow about five,’ replied the gazelle, and, giving a tug to the horse’s rein, they set off at a gallop.
The sultan watched them till they were out of sight: then he said to his attendants, ‘That gazelle comes from gentle hands, from the house of a sultan, and that is what makes it so different from other gazelles.’ And in the eyes of the sultan the gazelle became a person of consequence.
Meanwhile the gazelle ran on till it came to the place where its master was seated, and his heart laughed when he saw the gazelle.
And the gazelle said to him, ‘Get up, my master, and bathe in the stream!’ and when the man had bathed it said again, ‘Now rub yourself well with earth, and rub your teeth well with sand to make them bright and shining.’ And when this was done it said, ‘The sun has gone down behind the hills; it is time for us to go’: so it went and brought the clothes from the back of the horse, and the man put them on and was well pleased.
‘Master!’ said the gazelle when the man was ready, ‘be sure that where we are going you keep silence, except for giving greetings and asking for news. Leave all the talking to me. I have provided you with a wife, and have made her presents of clothes and turbans and rare and precious things, so it is needless for you to speak.’
‘Very good, I will be silent,’ replied the man as he mounted the horse. ‘You have given all this; it is you who are the master, and I who am the slave, and I will obey you in all things.’
‘So they went their way, and they went and went till the gazelle saw in the distance the palace of the sultan. Then it said, ‘Master, that is the house we are going to, and you are not a poor man any longer: even your name is new.’
‘What IS my name, eh, my father?’ asked the man.
‘Sultan Darai,’ said the gazelle.
Very soon some soldiers came to meet them, while others ran off to tell the sultan of their approach. And the sultan set off at once, and the viziers and the emirs, and the judges, and the rich men of the city, all followed him.
Directly the gazelle saw them coming, it said to its master: ‘Your father-in-law is coming to meet you; that is he in the middle, wearing a mantle of sky-blue. Get off your horse and go to greet him.’
And Sultan Darai leapt from his horse, and so did the other sultan, and they gave their hands to one another and kissed each other, and went together into the palace.
The next morning the gazelle went to the rooms of the sultan, and said to him: ‘My lord, we want you to marry us our wife, for the soul of Sultan Darai is eager.’
‘The wife is ready, so call the priest,’ answered he, and when the ceremony was over a cannon was fired and music was played, and within the palace there was feasting.
‘Master,’ said the gazelle the following morning, ‘I am setting out on a journey, and I shall not be back for seven days, and perhaps not then. But be careful not to leave the house till I come.’
And the master answered, ‘I will not leave the house.’
And it went to the sultan of the country and said to him: ‘My lord, Sultan Darai has sent me to his town to get the house in order. It will take me seven days, and if I am not back in seven days he will not leave the palace till I return.’
‘Very good,’ said the sultan.
And it went and it went through the forest and wilderness, till it arrived at a town full of fine houses. At the end of the chief road was a great house, beautiful exceedingly, built of sapphire and turquoise and marbles. ‘That,’ thought the gazelle, ‘is the house for my master, and I will call up my courage and go and look at the people who are in it, if any people there are. For in this town have I as yet seen no people. If I die, I die, and if I live, I live. Here can I think of no plan, so if anything is to kill me, it will kill me.’
Then it knocked twice at the door, and cried ‘Open,’ but no one answered. And it cried again, and a voice replied:
‘Who are you that are crying “Open”?’
And the gazelle said, ‘It is I, great mistress, your grandchild.’
‘If you are my grandchild,’ returned the voice, ‘go back whence you came. Don’t come and die here, and bring me to my death as well.’
‘Open, mistress, I entreat, I have something to say to you.’
‘Grandchild,’ replied she, ‘I fear to put your life in danger, and my own too.’
‘Oh, mistress, my life will not be lost, nor yours either; open, I pray you.’ So she opened the door.
‘What is the news where you come from, my grandson,’ asked she.
‘Great lady, where I come from it is well, and with you it is well.’
‘Ah, my son, here it is not well at all. If you seek a way to die, or if you have not yet seen death, then is to-day the day for you to know what dying is.’
‘If I am to know it, I shall know it,’ replied the gazelle; ‘but tell me, who is the lord of this house?’
And she said: ‘Ah, father! in this house is much wealth, and much people, and much food, and many horses. And the lord of it all is an exceeding great and wonderful snake.’
‘Oh!’ cried the gazelle when he heard this; ‘tell me how I can get at the snake to kill him?’
‘My son,’ returned the old woman, ‘do not say words like these; you risk both our lives. He has put me here all by myself, and I have to cook his food. When the great snake is coming there springs up a wind, and blows the dust about, and this goes on till the great snake glides into the courtyard and calls for his dinner, which must always be ready for him in those big pots. He eats till he has had enough, and then drinks a whole tankful of water. After that he goes away. Every second day he comes, when the sun is over the house. And he has seven heads. How then can you be a match for him, my son?’
‘Mind your own business, mother,’ answered the gazelle, ‘and don’t mind other people’s! Has this snake a sword?’
‘He has a sword, and a sharp one too. It cuts like a dash of lightning.’
‘Give it to me, mother!’ said the gazelle, and she unhooked the sword from the wall, as she was bidden. ‘You must be quick,’ she said, ‘for he may be here at any moment. Hark! is not that the wind rising? He has come!’
They were silent, but the old woman peeped from behind a curtain, and saw the snake busy at the pots which she had placed ready for him in the courtyard. And after he had done eating and drinking he came to the door:
‘You old body!’ he cried; ‘what smell is that I smell inside that is not the smell of every day?’
‘Oh, master!’ answered she, ‘I am alone, as I always am! But to-day, after many days, I have sprinkled fresh scent all over me, and it is that which you smell. What else could it be, master?’
All this time the gazelle had been standing close to the door, holding the sword in one of its front paws. And as the snake put one of his heads through the hole that he had made so as to get in and out comfortably, it cut it of so clean that the snake really did not feel it. The second blow was not quite so straight, for the snake said to himself, ‘Who is that who is trying to scratch me?’ and stretched out his third head to see; but no sooner was the neck through the hole than the head went rolling to join the rest.
When six of his heads were gone the snake lashed his tail with such fury that the gazelle and the old woman could not see each other for the dust he made. And the gazelle said to him, ‘You have climbed all sorts of trees, but this you can’t climb,’ and as the seventh head came darting through it went rolling to join the rest.
Then the sword fell rattling on the ground, for the gazelle had fainted.
The old woman shrieked with delight when she saw her enemy was dead, and ran to bring water to the gazelle, and fanned it, and put it where the wind could blow on it, till it grew better and gave a sneeze. And the heart of the old woman was glad, and she gave it more water, till by-and-by the gazelle got up.
‘Show me this house,’ it said, ‘from beginning to end, from top to bottom, from inside to out.’
So she arose and showed the gazelle rooms full of gold and precious things, and other rooms full of slaves. ‘They are all yours, goods and slaves,’ said she.
But the gazelle answered, ‘You must keep them safe till I call my master.’
For two days it lay and rested in the house, and fed on milk and rice, and on the third day it bade the old woman farewell and started back to its master.
And when he heard that the gazelle was at the door he felt like a man who has found the time when all prayers are granted, and he rose and kissed it, saying: ‘My father, you have been a long time; you have left sorrow with me. I cannot eat, I cannot drink, I cannot laugh; my heart felt no smile at anything, because of thinking of you.’
And the gazelle answered: ‘I am well, and where I come from it is well, and I wish that after four days you would take your wife and go home.’
And he said: ‘It is for you to speak. Where you go, I will follow.’
‘Then I shall go to your father-in-law and tell him this news.’
‘Go, my son.’
So the gazelle went to the father-in-law and said: ‘I am sent by my master to come and tell you that after four days he will go away with his wife to his own home.’
‘Must he really go so quickly? We have not yet sat much together, I and Sultan Darai, nor have we yet talked much together, nor have we yet ridden out together, nor have we eaten together; yet it is fourteen days since he came.’
But the gazelle replied: ‘My lord, you cannot help it, for he wishes to go home, and nothing will stop him.’
‘Very good,’ said the sultan, and he called all the people who were in the town, and commanded that the day his daughter left the palace ladies and guards were to attend her on her way.
And at the end of four days a great company of ladies and slaves and horses went forth to escort the wife of Sultan Darai to her new home. They rode all day, and when the sun sank behind the hills they rested, and ate of the food the gazelle gave them, and lay down to sleep. And they journeyed on for many days, and they all, nobles and slaves, loved the gazelle with a great love– more than they loved the Sultan Darai.
At last one day signs of houses appeared, far, far off. And those who saw cried out, ‘Gazelle!’
And it answered, ‘Ah, my mistresses, that is the house of Sultan Darai.’
At this news the women rejoiced much, and the slaves rejoiced much, and in the space of two hours they came to the gates, and the gazelle bade them all stay behind, and it went on to the house with Sultan Darai.
When the old woman saw them coming through the courtyard she jumped and shouted for joy, and as the gazelle drew near she seized it in her arms, and kissed it. The gazelle did not like this, and said to her: ‘Old woman, leave me alone; the one to be carried is my master, and the one to be kissed is my master.’
And she answered, ‘Forgive me, my son. I did not know this was our master,’ and she threw open all the doors so that the master might see everything that the rooms and storehouses contained. Sultan Darai looked about him, and at length he said:
‘Unfasten those horses that are tied up, and let loose those people that are bound. And let some sweep, and some spread the beds, and some cook, and some draw water, and some come out and receive the mistress.’
And when the sultana and her ladies and her slaves entered the house, and saw the rich stuffs it was hung with, and the beautiful rice that was prepared for them to eat, they cried: ‘Ah, you gazelle, we have seen great houses, we have seen people, we have heard of things. But this house, and you, such as you are, we have never seen or heard of.’
After a few days, the ladies said they wished to go home again. The gazelle begged them hard to stay, but finding they would not, it brought many gifts, and gave some to the ladies and some to their slaves. And they all thought the gazelle greater a thousand times than its master, Sultan Darai.
The gazelle and its master remained in the house many weeks, and one day it said to the old woman, ‘I came with my master to this place, and I have done many things for my master, good things, and till to-day he has never asked me: “Well, my gazelle, how did you get this house? Who is the owner of it? And this town, were there no people in it?” All good things I have done for the master, and he has not one day done me any good thing. But people say, “If you want to do any one good, don’t do him good only, do him evil also, and there will be peace between you.” So, mother, I have done: I want to see the favours I have done to my master, that he may do me the like.’
‘Good,’ replied the old woman, and they went to bed.
In the morning, when light came, the gazelle was sick in its stomach and feverish, and its legs ached. And it said ‘Mother!’
And she answered, ‘Here, my son?’
And it said, ‘Go and tell my master upstairs the gazelle is very ill.’
‘Very good, my son; and if he should ask me what is the matter, what am I to say?’
‘Tell him all my body aches badly; I have no single part without pain.’
The old woman went upstairs, and she found the mistress and master sitting on a couch of marble spread with soft cushions, and they asked her, ‘Well, old woman, what do you want?’
‘To tell the master the gazelle is ill,’ said she.
‘What is the matter?’ asked the wife.
‘All its body pains; there is no part without pain.’
‘Well, what can I do? Make some gruel of red millet, and give to it.’
But his wife stared and said: ‘Oh, master, do you tell her to make the gazelle gruel out of red millet, which a horse would not eat? Eh, master, that is not well.’
But he answered, ‘Oh, you are mad! Rice is only kept for people.’
‘Eh, master, this is not like a gazelle. It is the apple of your eye. If sand got into that, it would trouble you.’
‘My wife, your tongue is long,’ and he left the room.
The old woman saw she had spoken vainly, and went back weeping to the gazelle. And when the gazelle saw her it said, ‘Mother, what is it, and why do you cry? If it be good, give me the answer; and if it be bad, give me the answer.’
But still the old woman would not speak, and the gazelle prayed her to let it know the words of the master. At last she said: ‘I went upstairs and found the mistress and the master sitting on a couch, and he asked me what I wanted, and I told him that you, his slave, were ill. And his wife asked what was the matter, and I told her that there was not a part of your body without pain. And the master told me to take some red millet and make you gruel, but the mistress said, ‘Eh, master, the gazelle is the apple of your eye; you have no child, this gazelle is like your child; so this gazelle is not one to be done evil to. This is a gazelle in form, but not a gazelle in heart; he is in all things better than a gentleman, be he who he may.’
And he answered her, ‘Silly chatterer, your words are many. I know its price; I bought it for an eighth. What loss will it be to me?’
The gazelle kept silence for a few moments. Then it said, ‘The elders said, “One that does good like a mother,” and I have done him good, and I have got this that the elders said. But go up again to the master, and tell him the gazelle is very ill, and it has not drunk the gruel of red millet.’
So the old woman returned, and found the master and the mistress drinking coffee. And when he heard what the gazelle had said, he cried: ‘Hold your peace, old woman, and stay your feet and close your eyes, and stop your ears with wax; and if the gazelle bids you come to me, say your legs are bent, and you cannot walk; and if it begs you to listen, say your ears are stopped with wax; and if it wishes to talk, reply that your tongue has got a hook in it.’
The heart of the old woman wept as she heard such words, because she saw that when the gazelle first came to that town it was ready to sell its life to buy wealth for its master. Then it happened to get both life and wealth, but now it had no honour with its master.
And tears sprung likewise to the eyes of the sultan’s wife, and she said, ‘I am sorry for you, my husband, that you should deal so wickedly with that gazelle’; but he only answered, ‘Old woman, pay no heed to the talk of the mistress: tell it to perish out of the way. I cannot sleep, I cannot eat, I cannot drink, for the worry of that gazelle. Shall a creature that I bought for an eighth trouble me from morning till night? Not so, old woman!’
The old woman went downstairs, and there lay the gazelle, blood flowing from its nostrils. And she took it in her arms and said, ‘My son, the good you did is lost; there remains only patience.’
And it said, ‘Mother, I shall die, for my soul is full of anger and bitterness. My face is ashamed, that I should have done good to my master, and that he should repay me with evil.’ It paused for a moment, and then went on, ‘Mother, of the goods that are in this house, what do I eat? I might have every day half a basinful, and would my master be any the poorer? But did not the elders say, “He that does good like a mother!” ‘
And it said, ‘Go and tell my master that the gazelle is nearer death than life.’
So she went, and spoke as the gazelle had bidden her; but he answered, ‘I have told you to trouble me no more.’
But his wife’s heart was sore, and she said to him: ‘Ah, master, what has the gazelle done to you? How has he failed you? The things you do to him are not good, and you will draw on yourself the hatred of the people. For this gazelle is loved by all, by small and great, by women and men. Ah, my husband! I thought you had great wisdom, and you have not even a little!’
But he answered, ‘You are mad, my wife.’
The old woman stayed no longer, and went back to the gazelle, followed secretly by the mistress, who called a maidservant and bade her take some milk and rice and cook it for the gazelle.
‘Take also this cloth,’ she said, ‘to cover it with, and this pillow for its head. And if the gazelle wants more, let it ask me, and not its master. And if it will, I will send it in a litter to my father, and he will nurse it till it is well.’
And the maidservant did as her mistress bade her, and said what her mistress had told her to say, but the gazelle made no answer, but turned over on its side and died quietly.
When the news spread abroad, there was much weeping among the people, and Sultan Darai arose in wrath, and cried, ‘You weep for that gazelle as if you wept for me! And, after all, what is it but a gazelle, that I bought for an eighth?’
But his wife answered, ‘Master, we looked upon that gazelle as we looked upon you. It was the gazelle who came to ask me of my father, it was the gazelle who brought me from my father, and I was given in charge to the gazelle by my father.’
And when the people heard her they lifted up their voices and spoke:
‘We never saw you, we saw the gazelle. It was the gazelle who met with trouble here, it was the gazelle who met with rest here.
So, then, when such an one departs from this world we weep for ourselves, we do not weep for the gazelle.’
And they said furthermore:
‘The gazelle did you much good, and if anyone says he could have done more for you he is a liar! Therefore, to us who have done you no good, what treatment will you give? The gazelle has died from bitterness of soul, and you ordered your slaves to throw it into the well. Ah! leave us alone that we may weep.’
But Sultan Darai would not heed their words, and the dead gazelle was thrown into the well.
When the mistress heard of it, she sent three slaves, mounted on donkeys, with a letter to her father the sultan, and when the sultan had read the letter he bowed his head and wept, like a man who had lost his mother. And he commanded horses to be saddled, and called the governor and the judges and all the rich men, and said:
‘Come now with me; let us go and bury it.’
Night and day they travelled, till the sultan came to the well where the gazelle had been thrown. And it was a large well, built round a rock, with room for many people; and the sultan entered, and the judges and the rich men followed him. And when he saw the gazelle lying there he wept afresh, and took it in his arms and carried it away.
When the three slaves went and told their mistress what the sultan had done, and how all the people were weeping, she answered:
‘I too have eaten no food, neither have I drunk water, since the day the gazelle died. I have not spoken, and I have not laughed.’
The sultan took the gazelle and buried it, and ordered the people to wear mourning for it, so there was great mourning throughout the city.
Now after the days of mourning were at an end, the wife was sleeping at her husband’s side, and in her sleep she dreamed that she was once more in her father’s house, and when she woke up it was no dream.
And the man dreamed that he was on the dust-heap, scratching. And when he woke, behold! that also was no dream, but the truth.

Far away, in a very hot country, there once lived a man and woman who had two children, a son named Koane and a daughter called Thakane.
Early in the morning and late in the evenings the parents worked hard in the fields, resting, when the sun was high, under the shade of some tree. While they were absent the little girl kept house alone, for her brother always got up before the dawn, when the air was fresh and cool, and drove out the cattle to the sweetest patches of grass he could find.
One day, when Koane had slept later than usual, his father and mother went to their work before him, and there was only Thakane to be seen busy making the bread for supper.
‘Thakane,’ he said, ‘I am thirsty. Give me a drink from the tree Koumongoe, which has the best milk in the world.’
‘Oh, Koane,’ cried his sister, ‘you know that we are forbidden to touch that tree. What would father say when he came home? For he would be sure to know.’
‘Nonsense,’ replied Koane, ‘there is so much milk in Koumongoe that he will never miss a little. If you won’t give it to me, I sha’n’t take the cattle out. They will just have to stay all day in the hut, and you know that they will starve.’ And he turned from her in a rage, and sat down in the corner.
After a while Thakane said to him: ‘It is getting hot, had you better drive out the cattle now?’
But Koane only answered sulkily: ‘I told you I am not going to drive them out at all. If I have to do without milk, they shall do without grass.’
Thakane did not know what to do. She was afraid to disobey her parents, who would most likely beat her, yet the beasts would be sure to suffer if they were kept in, and she would perhaps be beaten for that too. So at last she took an axe and a tiny earthen bowl, she cut a very small hole in the side of Koumongoe, and out gushed enough milk to fill the bowl.
‘Here is the milk you wanted,’ said she, going up to Koane, who was still sulking in his corner.
‘What is the use of that?’ grumbled Koane; ‘why, there is not enough to drown a fly. Go and get me three times as much!’
Trembling with fright, Thakane returned to the tree, and struck it a sharp blow with the axe. In an instant there poured forth such a stream of milk that it ran like a river into the hut.
‘Koane! Koane!’ cried she, ‘come and help me to plug up the hole. There will be no milk left for our father and mother.’ But Koane could not stop it any more than Thakane, and soon the milk was flowing through the hut downhill towards their parents in the fields below.
The man saw a white stream a long way off, and guessed what had happened.
‘Wife, wife,’ he called loudly to the woman, who was working at a little distance: ‘Do you see Koumongoe running fast down the hill? That is some mischief of the children’s, I am sure. I must go home and find out what is the matter.’ And they both threw down their hoes and hurried to the side of Koumongoe.
Kneeling on the grass, the man and his wife made a cup of their hands and drank the milk from it. And no sooner had they done this, than Koumongoe flowed back again up the hill, and entered the hut.
‘Thakane,’ said the parents, severely, when they reached home panting from the heat of the sun, ‘what have you been doing? Why did Koumongoe come to us in the fields instead of staying in the garden?’
‘It was Koane’s fault,’ answered Thakane. ‘He would not take the cattle to feed until he drank some of the milk from Koumongoe. So, as I did not know what else to do, I gave it to him.’
The father listened to Thakane’s words, but made no answer. Instead, he went outside and brought in two sheepskins, which he stained red and sent for a blacksmith to forge some iron rings. The rings were then passed over Thakane’s arms and legs and neck, and the skins fastened on her before and behind. When all was ready, the man sent for his servants and said:
‘I am going to get rid of Thakane.’
‘Get rid of your only daughter?’ they answered, in surprise. ‘But why?’
‘Because she has eaten what she ought not to have eaten. She has touched the sacred tree which belongs to her mother and me alone.’ And, turning his back, he called to Thakane to follow him, and they went down the road which led to the dwelling of an ogre.
They were passing along some fields where the corn was ripening, when a rabbit suddenly sprang out at their feet, and standing on its hind legs, it sang:
Why do you give to the ogre Your child, so fair, so fair?
‘You had better ask her,’ replied the man, ‘she is old enough to give you an answer.’
Then, in her turn, Thakane sang:
I gave Koumongoe to Koane, Koumongoe to the keeper of beasts; For without Koumongoe they could not go to the meadows: Without Koumongoe they would starve in the hut; That was why I gave him the Koumongoe of my father.
And when the rabbit heard that, he cried: ‘Wretched man! it is you whom the ogre should eat, and not your beautiful daughter.’
But the father paid no heed to what the rabbit said, and only walked on the faster, bidding Thakane to keep close behind him. By-and-by they met with a troop of great deer, called elands, and they stopped when they saw Thakane and sang:
Why do you give to the ogre Your child, so fair, so fair?
‘You had better ask her, replied the man, ‘she is old enough to give you an answer.’
Then, in her turn, Thakane sang:
I gave Koumongoe to Koane, Koumongoe to the keeper of beasts; For without Koumongoe they could not go to the meadows: Without Koumongoe they would starve in the hut; That was why I gave him the Koumongoe of my father.
And the elands all cried: ‘Wretched man! it is you whom the ogre should eat, and not your beautiful daughter.’
By this time it was nearly dark, and the father said they could travel no further that night, and must go to sleep where they were. Thakane was thankful indeed when she heard this, for she was very tired, and found the two skins fastened round her almost too heavy to carry. So, in spite of her dread of the ogre, she slept till dawn, when her father woke her, and told her roughly that he was ready to continue their journey.
Crossing the plain, the girl and her father passed a herd of gazelles feeding. They lifted their heads, wondering who was out so early, and when they caught sight of Thakane, they sang:
Why do you give to the ogre Your child, so fair, so fair?
‘You had better ask her, replied the man, ‘she is old enough to answer for herself.’
Then, in her turn, Thakane sang:
I gave Koumongoe to Koane, Koumongoe to the keeper of beasts; For without Koumongoe they could not go to the meadows: Without Koumongoe they would starve in the hut; That was why I gave him the Koumongoe of my father.
And the gazelles all cried: ‘Wretched man! it is you whom the ogre should eat, and not your beautiful daughter.’
At last they arrived at the village where the ogre lived, and they went straight to his hut. He was nowhere to be seen, but in his place was his son Masilo, who was not an ogre at all, but a very polite young man. He ordered his servants to bring a pile of skins for Thakane to sit on, but told her father he must sit on the ground. Then, catching sight of the girl’s face, which she had kept down, he was struck by its beauty, and put the same question that the rabbit, and the elands, and the gazelles had done.
Thakane answered him as before, and he instantly commanded that she should be taken to the hut of his mother, and placed under her care, while the man should be led to his father. Directly the ogre saw him he bade the servant throw him into the great pot which always stood ready on the fire, and in five minutes he was done to a turn. After that the servant returned to Masilo and related all that had happened.
Now Masilo had fallen in loved with Thakane the moment he saw her. At first he did not know what to make of this strange feeling, for all his life he had hated women, and had refused several brides whom his parents had chosen for him. However, they were so anxious that he should marry, that they willingly accepted Thakane as their daughter-in-law, though she did bring any marriage portion with her.
After some time a baby was born to her, and Thakane thought it was the most beautiful baby that ever was seen. But when her mother-in-law saw it was a girl, she wrung her hands and wept, saying:
‘O miserable mother! Miserable child! Alas for you! why were you not a boy!’
Thakane, in great surprise, asked the meaning of her distress; and the old woman told her that it was the custom in that country that all the girls who were born should be given to the ogre to eat.
Then Thakane clasped the baby tightly in her arms, and cried:
‘But it is not the customer in MY country! There, when children die, they are buried in the earth. No one shall take my baby from me.’
That night, when everyone in the hut was asleep, Thakane rose, and carrying her baby on her back, went down to a place where the river spread itself out into a large lake, with tall willows all round the bank. Here, hidden from everyone, she sat down on a stone and began to think what she should do to save her child.
Suddenly she heard a rustling among the willows, and an old woman appeared before her.
‘What are you crying for, my dear?’ said she.
And Thakane answered: ‘I was crying for my baby–I cannot hide her for ever, and if the ogre sees her, he will eat her; and I would rather she was drowned than that.’
‘What you say is true,’ replied the old woman. ‘Give me your child, and let me take care of it. And if you will fix a day to meet me here I will bring the baby.’
Then Thakane dried her eyes, and gladly accepted the old woman’s offer. When she got home she told her husband she had thrown it in the river, and as he had watched her go in that direction he never thought of doubting what she said.
On the appointed day, Thakane slipped out when everybody was busy, and ran down the path that led to the lake. As soon as she got there, she crouched down among the willows, and sang softly:
Bring to me Dilah, Dilah the rejected one, Dilah, whom her father Masilo cast out!
And in a moment the old woman appeared holding the baby in her arms. Dilah had become so big and strong, that Thakane’s heart was filled with joy and gratitude, and she stayed as long as she dared, playing with her baby. At last she felt she must return to the village, lest she should be missed, and the child was handed back to the old woman, who vanished with her into the lake.
Children grow up very quickly when they live under water, and in less time than anyone could suppose, Dilah had changed from a baby to a woman. Her mother came to visit her whenever she was able, and one day, when they were sitting talking together, they were spied out by a man who had come to cut willows to weave into baskets. He was so surprised to see how like the face of the girl was to Masilo, that he left his work and returned to the village.
‘Masilo,’ he said, as he entered the hut, ‘I have just beheld your wife near the river with a girl who must be your daughter, she is so like you. We have been deceived, for we all thought she was dead.’
When he heard this, Masilo tried to look shocked because his wife had broken the law; but in his heart he was very glad.
‘But what shall we do now?’ asked he.
‘Make sure for yourself that I am speaking the truth by hiding among the bushes the first time Thakane says she is going to bathe in the river, and waiting till the girl appears.’
For some days Thakane stayed quietly at home, and her husband began to think that the man had been mistaken; but at last she said to her husband: ‘I am going to bathe in the river.’
‘Well, you can go,’ answered he. But he ran down quickly by another path, and got there first, and hid himself in the bushes. An instant later, Thakane arrived, and standing on the bank, she sang:
Bring to me Dilah, Dilah the rejected one, Dilah, whom her father Masilo cast out!
Then the old woman came out of the water, holding the girl, now tall and slender, by the hand. And as Masilo looked, he saw that she was indeed his daughter, and he wept for joy that she was not lying dead in the bottom of the lake. The old woman, however, seemed uneasy, and said to Thakane: ‘I feel as if someone was watching us. I will not leave the girl to-day, but will take her back with me’; and sinking beneath the surface, she drew the girl after her. After they had gone, Thakane returned to the village, which Masilo had managed to reach before her.
All the rest of the day he sat in a corner weeping, and his mother who came in asked: ‘Why are you weeping so bitterly, my son?’
‘My head aches,’ he answered; ‘it aches very badly.’ And his mother passed on, and left him alone.
In the evening he said to his wife: ‘I have seen my daughter, in the place where you told me you had drowned her. Instead, she lives at the bottom of the lake, and has now grown into a young woman.’
‘I don’t know what you are talking about,’ replied Thakane. ‘I buried my child under the sand on the beach.’
Then Masilo implored her to give the child back to him; but she would not listen, and only answered: ‘If I were to give her back you would only obey the laws of your country and take her to your father, the ogre, and she would be eaten.’
But Masilo promised that he would never let his father see her, and that now she was a woman no one would try to hurt her; so Thakane’s heart melted, and she went down to the lake to consult the old woman.
‘What am I to do?’ she asked, when, after clapping her hands, the old woman appeared before her. ‘Yesterday Masilo beheld Dilah, and ever since he has entreated me to give him back his daughter.’
‘If I let her go he must pay me a thousand head of cattle in exchange,’ replied the old woman. And Thakane carried her answer back to Masilo.
‘Why, I would gladly give her two thousand!’ cried he, ‘for she has saved my daughter.’ And he bade messengers hasten to all the neighbouring villages, and tell his people to send him at once all the cattle he possessed. When they were all assembled he chose a thousand of the finest bulls and cows, and drove them down to the river, followed by a great crowd wondering what would happen.
Then Thakane stepped forward in front of the cattle and sang:
Bring to me Dilah, Dilah the rejected one, Dilah, whom her father Masilo cast out!
And Dilah came from the waters holding out her hands to Masilo and Thakane, and in her place the cattle sank into the lake, and were driven by the old woman to the great city filled with people, which lies at the bottom.

There was once a man whose name was Dschemil, and he had a cousin who was called Dschemila. They had been betrothed by their parents when they were children, and now Dschemil thought that the time had come for them to be married, and he went two or three days’ journey, to the nearest big town, to buy furniture for the new house.
While he was away, Dschemila and her friends set off to the neighbouring woods to pick up sticks, and as she gathered them she found an iron mortar lying on the ground. She placed it on her bundle of sticks, but the mortar would not stay still, and whenever she raised the bundle to put it on her shoulders it slipped off sideways. At length she saw the only way to carry the mortar was to tie it in the very middle of her bundle, and had just unfastened her sticks, when she heard her companions’ voices.
‘Dschemila, what are you doing? it is almost dark, and if you mean to come with us you must be quick!’
But Dschemila only replied, ‘You had better go back without me, for I am not going to leave my mortar behind, if I stay here till midnight.’
‘Do as you like,’ said the girls, and started on their walk home.
The night soon fell, and at the last ray of light the mortar suddenly became an ogre, who threw Dschemila on his back, and carried her off into a desert place, distant a whole month’s journey from her native town. Here he shut her into a castle, and told her not to fear, as her life was safe. Then he went back to his wife, leaving Dschemila weeping over the fate that she had brought upon herself.
Meanwhile the other girls had reached home, and Dschemila’s mother came out to look for her daughter.
‘What have you done with her?’ she asked anxiously.
‘We had to leave her in the wood,’ they replied, ‘for she had picked up an iron mortar, and could not manage to carry it.’
So the old woman set off at once for the forest, calling to her daughter as she hurried along.
‘Do go home,’ cried the townspeople, as they heard her; ‘we will go and look for your daughter; you are only a woman, and it is a task that needs strong men.’
But she answered, ‘Yes, go; but I will go with you! Perhaps it will be only her corpse that we shall find after all. She has most likely been stung by asps, or eaten by wild beasts.’
The men, seeing her heart was bent on it, said no more, but told one of the girls she must come with them, and show them the place where they had left Dschemila. They found the bundle of wood lying where she had dropped it, but the maiden was nowhere to be seen.
‘Dschemila! Dschemila!’ cried they; but nobody answered.
‘If we make a fire, perhaps she will see it,’ said one of the men. And they lit a fire, and then went, one this way, and one that, through the forest, to look for her, whispering to each other that if she had been killed by a lion they would be sure to find some trace of it; or if she had fallen asleep, the sound of their voices would wake her; or if a snake had bitten her, they would at least come on her corpse.
All night they searched, and when morning broke and they knew no more than before what had become of the maiden, they grew weary, and said to the mother: ‘It is no use. Let us go home, nothing has happened to your daughter, except that she has run away with a man.’
‘Yes, I will come,’ answered she, ‘but I must first look in the river. Perhaps some one has thrown her in there.’ But the maiden was not in the river.
For four days the father and mother waited and watched for their child to come back; then they gave up hope, and said to each other: ‘What is to be done? What are we to say to the man to whom Dschemila is betrothed? Let us kill a goat, and bury its head in the grave, and when the man returns we must tell him Dschemila is dead.’
Very soon the bridegroom came back, bringing with him carpets and soft cushions for the house of his bride. And as he entered the town Dschemila’s father met him, saying, ‘Greeting to you. She is dead.’
At these words the young man broke into loud cries, and it was some time before he could speak. Then he turned to one of the crowd who had gathered round him, and asked: ‘Where have they buried her?’
‘Come to the churchyard with me,’ answered he; and the young man went with him, carrying with him some of the beautiful things he had brought. These he laid on the grass and then began to weep afresh. All day he stayed, and at nightfall he gathered up his stuffs and carried them to his own house. But when the day dawned he took them in his arms and returned to the grave, where he remained as long as it was light, playing softly on his flute. And this he did daily for six months.
One morning, a man who was wandering through the desert, having lost his way, came upon a lonely castle. The sun was very hot, and the man was very tired, so he said to himself, ‘I will rest a little in the shadow of this castle.’ He stretched himself out comfortably, and was almost asleep, when he heard a voice calling to him softly:
‘Are you a ghost,’ it said, ‘or a man?’
He looked up, and saw a girl leaning out of a window, and he answered:
‘I am a man, and a better one, too, than your father or your grandfather.’
‘May all good luck be with you,’ said she; ‘but what has brought you into this land of ogres and horrors?’
‘Does an ogre really live in this castle?’ asked he.
‘Certainly he does,’ replied the girl, ‘and as night is not far off he will be here soon. So, dear friend, depart quickly, lest he return and snap you up for supper.’
‘But I am so thirsty! ‘ said the man. ‘Be kind, and give me some drink, or else I shall die! Surely, even in this desert there must be some spring?’
‘Well, I have noticed that whenever the ogre brings back water he always comes from that side; so if you follow the same direction perhaps you may find some.’
The man jumped up at once and was about to start, when the maiden spoke again: ‘Tell me, where are you going?’
‘Why do you want to know?’
‘I have an errand for you; but tell me first whether you go east or west.’
‘I travel to Damascus.’
‘Then do this for me. As you pass through our village, ask for a man called Dschemil, and say to him: “Dschemila greets you, from the castle, which lies far away, and is rocked by the wind. In my grave lies only a goat. So take heart.” ‘
And the man promised, and went his way, till he came to a spring of water. And he drank a great draught and then lay on the bank and slept quietly. When he woke he said to himself, ‘The maiden did a good deed when she told me where to find water. A few hours more, and I should have been dead. So I will do her bidding, and seek out her native town and the man for whom the message was given.’
For a whole month he travelled, till at last he reached the town where Dschemil dwelt, and as luck would have it, there was the young man sitting before his door with his beard unshaven and his shaggy hair hanging over his eyes.
‘Welcome, stranger,’ said Dschemil, as the man stopped. ‘Where have you come from?’
‘I come from the west, and go towards the east,’ he answered.
‘Well, stop with us awhile, and rest and eat!’ said Dschemil. And the man entered; and food was set before him, and he sat down with the father of the maiden and her brothers, and Dschemil. Only Dschemil himself was absent, squatting on the threshold.
‘Why do you not eat too?’ asked the stranger. But one of the young men whispered hastily: ‘Leave him alone. Take no notice! It is only at night that he ever eats.’
So the stranger went on silently with his food. Suddenly one of Dschemil’s brothers called out and said: ‘Dschemil, bring us some water! ‘ And the stranger remembered his message and said:
‘Is there a man here named “Dschemil”? I lost my way in the desert, and came to a castle, and a maiden looked out of the window and . . . ‘
‘Be quiet,’ they cried, fearing that Dschemil might hear. But Dschemil had heard, and came forward and said:
‘What did you see? Tell me truly, or I will cut off your head this instant!’
‘My lord,’ replied the stranger, ‘as I was wandering, hot and tired, through the desert, I saw near me a great castle, and I said aloud, “I will rest a little in its shadow.” And a maiden looked out of a window and said, “Are you a ghost or a man? “And I answered, “I am a man, and a better one, too, than your father or your grandfather.” And I was thirsty and asked for water, but she had none to give me, and I felt like to die. Then she told me that the ogre, in whose castle she dwelt, brought in water always from the same side, and that if I too went that way most likely I should come to it. But before I started she begged me to go to her native town, and if I met a man called Dschemil I was to say to him, “Dschemila greets you, from the castle which lies far away, and is rocked by the wind. In my grave lies only a goat. So take heart.”‘
Then Dschemil turned to his family and said: ‘Is this true? and is Dschemila not dead at all, but simply stolen from her home?’
‘No, no,’ replied they, ‘his story is a pack of lies. Dschemila is really dead. Everybody knows it.’
‘That I shall see for myself,’ said Dschemil, and, snatching up a spade, hastened off to the grave where the goat’s head lay buried.
And they answered, ‘Then hear what really happened. When you were away, she went with the other maidens to the forest to gather wood. And there she found an iron mortar, which she wished to bring home; but she could not carry it, neither would she leave it. So the maidens returned without her, and as night was come, we all set out to look for her, but found nothing. And we said, “The bridegroom will be here to- morrow, and when he learns that she is lost, he will set out to seek her, and we shall lose him too. Let us kill a goat, and bury it in her grave, and tell him she is dead.” Now you know, so do as you will. Only, if you go to seek her, take with you this man with whom she has spoken that he may show you the way.’ ‘Yes; that is the best plan,’ replied Dschemil; ‘so give me food, and hand me my sword, and we will set out directly.’
But the stranger answered: ‘I am not going to waste a whole month in leading you to the castle! If it were only a day or two’s journey I would not mind; but a month–no!’
‘Come with me then for three days,’ said Dschemil, ‘and put me in the right road, and I will reward you richly.’
‘Very well,’ replied the stranger, ‘so let it be.’
For three days they travelled from sunrise to sunset, then the stranger said: ‘Dschemil?’
‘Yes,’ replied he.
‘Go straight on till you reach a spring, then go on a little farther, and soon you will see the castle standing before you.’
‘So I will,’ said Dschemil.
‘Farewell, then,’ said the stranger, and turned back the way he had come.
It was six and twenty days before Dschemil caught sight of a green spot rising out of the sandy desert, and knew that the spring was near at last. He hastened his steps, and soon was kneeling by its side, drinking thirstily of the bubbling water. Then he lay down on the cool grass, and began to think. ‘If the man was right, the castle must be somewhere about. I had better sleep here to-night, and to-morrow I shall be able to see where it is.’ So he slept long and peacefully. When he awoke the sun was high, and he jumped up and washed his face and hands in the spring, before going on his journey. He had not walked far, when the castle suddenly appeared before him, though a moment before not a trace of it could be seen. ‘How am I to get in?’ he thought. ‘I dare not knock, lest the ogre should hear me. Perhaps it would be best for me to climb up the wall, and wait to see what will happen. So he did, and after sitting on the top for about an hour, a window above him opened, and a voice said: ‘Dschemil!’ He looked up, and at the sight of Dschemila, whom he had so long believed to be dead, he began to weep.
‘Dear cousin,’ she whispered, ‘what has brought you here?’
‘My grief at losing you.’
‘Oh! go away at once. If the ogre comes back he will kill you.’
‘I swear by your head, queen of my heart, that I have not found you only to lose you again! If I must die, well, I must!’
‘Oh, what can I do for you?’
‘Anything you like!’
‘If I let you down a cord, can you make it fast under your arms, and climb up?’
‘Of course I can,’ said he.
So Dschemila lowered the cord, and Dschemil tied it round him, and climbed up to her window. Then they embraced each other tenderly, and burst into tears of joy.
‘But what shall I do when the ogre returns?’ asked she.
‘Trust to me,’ he said.
Now there was a chest in the room, where Dschemila kept her clothes. And she made Dschemil get into it, and lie at the bottom, and told him to keep very still.
He was only hidden just in time, for the lid was hardly closed when the ogre’s heavy tread was heard on the stairs. He flung open the door, bringing men’s flesh for himself and lamb’s flesh for the maiden. ‘I smell the smell of a man!’ he thundered. ‘What is he doing here?’
‘How could any one have come to this desert place?’ asked the girl, and burst into tears.
‘Do not cry,’ said the ogre; ‘perhaps a raven has dropped some scraps from his claws.’
‘Ah, yes, I was forgetting,’ answered she. ‘One did drop some bones about.’
‘Well, burn them to powder,’ replied the ogre, ‘so that I may swallow it.’
So the maiden took some bones and burned them, and gave them to the ogre, saying, ‘ Here is the powder, swallow it.’
And when he had swallowed the powder the ogre stretched himself out and went to sleep.
In a little while the man’s flesh, which the maiden was cooking for the ogre’s supper, called out and said:
‘Hist! Hist! A man lies in the kist! ‘
And the lamb’s flesh answered:
‘He is your brother, And cousin of the other.’
The ogre moved sleepily, and asked, ‘What did the meat say, Dschemila?’
‘Only that I must be sure to add salt.’
‘Well, add salt.’
‘Yes, I have done so,’ said she.
The ogre was soon sound asleep again, when the man’s flesh called out a second time:
‘Hist! Hist! A man lies in the kist!’
And the lamb’s flesh answered:
‘He is your brother, And cousin of the other.’
‘What did it say, Dschemila?’ asked the ogre.
‘Only that I must add pepper.’
‘Well, add pepper.’
‘Yes, I have done so,’ said she.
The ogre had had a long day’s hunting, and could not keep himself awake. In a moment his eyes were tight shut, and then the man’s flesh called out for the third time:
‘Hist! Hist A man lies in the kist,’
And the lamb’s flesh answered:
‘He is your brother, And cousin of the other.’
‘What did it say, Dschemila?’ asked the ogre.
‘Only that it was ready, and that I had better take it off the fire.’
‘Then if it is ready, bring it to me, and I will eat it.’
So she brought it to him, and while he was eating she supped off the lamb’s flesh herself, and managed to put some aside for her cousin.
When the ogre had finished, and had washed his hands, he said to Dschemila: ‘Make my bed, for I am tired.’
So she made his bed, and put a nice soft pillow for his head, and tucked him up.
‘Father,’ she said suddenly.
‘Well, what is it?’
‘Dear father, if you are really asleep, why are your eyes always open?’
‘Why do you ask that, Dschemila? Do you want to deal treacherously with me?’
‘No, of course not, father. How could I, and what would be the use of it?’
‘Well, why do you want to know?’
‘Because last night I woke up and saw the whole place shining in a red light, which frightened me.’
‘That happens when I am fast asleep.’
‘And what is the good of the pin you always keep here so carefully?’
‘If I throw that pin in front of me, it turns into an iron mountain.’
‘And this darning needle?’
‘That becomes a sea.’
‘And this hatchet?’
‘That becomes a thorn hedge, which no one can pass through. But why do you ask all these questions? I am sure you have something in your head.’
‘Oh, I just wanted to know; and how could anyone find me out here?’ and she began to cry.
‘Oh, don’t cry, I was only in fun,’ said the ogre.
He was soon asleep again, and a yellow light shone through the castle.
‘Come quick!’ called Dschemil from the chest; ‘we must fly now while the ogre is asleep.’
‘Not yet,’ she said, ‘there is a yellow light shining. I don’t think he is asleep.’
So they waited for an hour. Then Dschemil whispered again: ‘Wake up! There is no time to lose!’
‘Let me see if he is asleep,’ said she, and she peeped in, and saw a red light shining. Then she stole back to her cousin, and asked, ‘But how are we to get out?’
‘Get the rope, and I will let you down.’
So she fetched the rope, the hatchet, and the pin and the needles, and said, ‘Take them, and put them in the pocket of your cloak, and be sure not to lose them.’
Dschemil put them carefully in his pocket, and tied the rope round her, and let her down over the wall.
‘Are you safe?’ he asked.
‘Yes, quite.’
‘Then untie the rope, so that I may draw it up.’
And Dschemila did as she was told, and in a few minutes he stood beside her.
Now all this time the ogre was asleep, and had heard nothing. Then his dog came to him and said, ‘O, sleeper, are you having pleasant dreams? Dschemila has forsaken you and run away.’
The ogre got out of bed, gave the dog a kick, then went back again, and slept till morning.
When it grew light, he rose, and called, ‘Dschemila! Dschemila!’ but he only heard the echo of his own voice! Then he dressed himself quickly; buckled on his sword and whistled to his dog, and followed the road which he knew the fugitives must have taken. ‘Cousin,’ said Dschemila suddenly, and turning round as she spoke.
‘What is it?’ answered he.
‘The ogre is coming after us. I saw him.’
‘But where is he? I don’t see him.’
‘Over there. He only looks about as tall as a needle.’
Then they both began to run as fast as they could, while the ogre and his dog kept drawing always nearer. A few more steps, and he would have been by their side, when Dschemila threw the darning needle behind her. In a moment it became an iron mountain between them and their enemy.
‘We will break it down, my dog and I,’ cried the ogre in a rage, and they dashed at the mountain till they had forced a path through, and came ever nearer and nearer.
‘Cousin! ‘ said Dschemila suddenly.
‘What is it?’
‘The ogre is coming after us with his dog.’
‘You go on in front then,’ answered he; and they both ran on as fast as they could, while the ogre and the dog drew always nearer and nearer.
‘They are close upon us! ‘ cried the maiden, glancing behind, ‘you must throw the pin.’
So Dschemil took the pin from his cloak and threw it behind him, and a dense thicket of thorns sprang up round them, which the ogre and his dog could not pass through.
‘I will get through it somehow, if I burrow underground,’ cried he, and very soon he and the dog were on the other side.
‘Cousin,’ said Dschemila, ‘they are close to us now.’
‘Go on in front, and fear nothing,’ replied Dschemil.
So she ran on a little way, and then stopped.
‘He is only a few yards away now,’ she said, and Dschemil flung the hatchet on the ground, and it turned into a lake.
‘I will drink, and my dog shall drink, till it is dry,’ shrieked the ogre, and the dog drank so much that it burst and died. But the ogre did not stop for that, and soon the whole lake was nearly dry. Then he exclaimed, ‘Dschemila, let your head become a donkey’s head, and your hair fur!’
But when it was done, Dschemil looked at her in horror, and said, ‘ She is really a donkey, and not a woman at all! ‘
And he left her, and went home.
For two days poor Dschemila wandered about alone, weeping bitterly. When her cousin drew near his native town, he began to think over his conduct, and to feel ashamed of himself.
‘Perhaps by this time she has changed back to her proper shape,’ he said to himself, ‘I will go and see!’
So he made all the haste he could, and at last he saw her seated on a rock, trying to keep off the wolves, who longed to have her for dinner. He drove them off and said, ‘Get up, dear cousin, you have had a narrow escape.’
Dschemila stood up and answered, ‘Bravo, my friend. You persuaded me to fly with you, and then left me helplessly to my fate.’
‘Shall I tell you the truth?’ asked he.
‘Tell it.’
‘I thought you were a witch, and I was afraid of you.’
‘Did you not see me before my transformation? and did you not watch it happen under your very eyes, when the ogre bewitched me?’
‘What shall I do?’ said Dschemil. ‘If I take you into the town, everyone will laugh, and say, “Is that a new kind of toy you have got? It has hands like a woman, feet like a woman, the body of a woman; but its head is the head of an ass, and its hair is fur.” ‘
‘Well, what do you mean to do with me?’ asked Dschemila. ‘Better take me home to my mother by night, and tell no one anything about it.’
‘So I will,’ said he.
They waited where they were till it was nearly dark, then Dschemil brought his cousin home.
‘Is that Dschemil?’ asked the mother when he knocked softly.
‘Yes, it is.’
‘And have you found her?’
‘Yes, and I have brought her to you.’
‘Oh, where is she? let me see her!’ cried the mother.
‘Here, behind me,’ answered Dschemil.
But when the poor woman caught sight of her daughter, she shrieked, and exclaimed, ‘Are you making fun of me? When did I ever give birth to an ass?’
‘Hush!’ said Dschemil, ‘it is not necessary to let the whole world know! And if you look at her body, you will see two scars on it.’
‘Mother,’ sobbed Dschemila, ‘do you really not know your own daughter?’
‘Yes, of course I know her.’
‘What are her two scars then?’
‘On her thigh is a scar from the bite of a dog, and on her breast is the mark of a burn, where she pulled a lamp over her when she was little.’
‘Then look at me, and see if I am not your daughter,’ said Dschemila, throwing off her clothes and showing her two scars.
And at the sight her mother embraced her, weeping.
‘Dear daughter,’ she cried, ‘what evil fate has befallen you?’
‘It was the ogre who carried me off first, and then bewitched me,’ answered Dschemila.
‘But what is to be done with you?’ asked her mother.
‘Hide me away, and tell no one anything about me. And you, dear cousin, say nothing to the neighbours, and if they should put questions, you can make answer that I have not yet been found.’
‘So I will,’ replied he.
Then he and her mother took her upstairs and hid her in a cupboard, where she stayed for a whole month, only going out to walk when all the world was asleep.
Meanwhile Dschemil had returned to his own home, where his father and mother, his brothers and neighbours, greeted him joyfully.
‘When did you come back?’ said they, ‘and have you found Dschemila?’
‘No, I searched the whole world after her, and could hear nothing of her.’
‘Did you part company with the man who started with you?’
‘Yes; after three days he got so weak and useless he could not go on. It must be a month by now since he reached home again. I went on and visited every castle, and looked in every house. But there were no signs of her; and so I gave it up.’
And they answered him: ‘We told you before that it was no good. An ogre or an ogress must have snapped her up, and how can you expect to find her?’
‘I loved her too much to be still,’ he said.
But his friends did not understand, and soon they spoke to him again about it.
‘We will seek for a wife for you. There are plenty of girls prettier than Dschemila.’
‘I dare say; but I don’t want them.’
‘But what will you do with all the cushions and carpets, and beautiful things you bought for your house?’
‘They can stay in the chests.’
‘But the moths will eat them! For a few weeks, it is of no consequence, but after a year or two they will be quite useless.’
‘And if they have to lie there ten years I will have Dschemila, and her only, for my wife. For a month, or even two months, I will rest here quietly. Then I will go and seek her afresh.’
‘Oh, you are quite mad! Is she the only maiden in the world? There are plenty of others better worth having than she is.’
‘If there are I have not seen them! And why do you make all this fuss? Every man knows his own business best.
‘Why, it is you who are making all the fuss yourself.’
But Dschemil turned and went into the house, for he did not want to quarrel.
Three months later a Jew, who was travelling across the desert, came to the castle, and laid himself down under the wall to rest.
In the evening the ogre saw him there and said to him, ‘Jew, what are you doing here? Have you anything to sell?’
‘I have only some clothes,’ answered the Jew, who was in mortal terror of the ogre.
‘Oh, don’t be afraid of me,’ said the ogre, laughing. ‘I shall not eat you. Indeed, I mean to go a bit of the way with you myself.’
‘I am ready, gracious sir,’ replied the Jew, rising to his feet.
‘Well, go straight on till you reach a town, and in that town you will find a maiden called Dschemila and a young man called Dschemil. Take this mirror and this comb with you, and say to Dschemila, “Your father, the ogre, greets you, and begs you to look at your face in this mirror, and it will appear as it was before, and to comb your hair with this comb, and it will be as formerly.” If you do not carry out my orders, I will eat you the next time we meet.’
‘Oh, I will obey you punctually,’ cried the Jew.
After thirty days the Jew entered the gate of the town, and sat down in the first street he came to, hungry, thirsty, and very tired.
Quite by chance, Dschemil happened to pass by, and seeing a man sitting there, full in the glare of the sun, he stopped, and said, ‘ Get up at once, Jew; you will have a sunstroke if you sit in such a place.’
‘Ah, good sir,’ replied the Jew, ‘for a whole month I have been travelling, and I am too tired to move.’
‘Which way did you come?’ asked Dschemil.
‘From out there,’ answered the Jew pointing behind him.
‘And you have been travelling for a month, you say? Well, did you see anything remarkable?’
‘Yes, good sir; I saw a castle, and lay down to rest under its shadow. And an ogre woke me, and told me to come to this town, where I should find a young man called Dschemil, and a girl called Dschemila.’
‘My name is Dschemil. What does the ogre want with me?’
‘He gave me some presents for Dschemila. How can I see her?’
‘Come with me, and you shall give them into her own hands.’
So the two went together to the house of Dschemil’s uncle, and Dschemil led the Jew into his aunt’s room.
‘Aunt!’ he cried, ‘this Jew who is with me has come from the ogre, and has brought with him, as presents, a mirror and a comb which the ogre has sent her.’
‘But it may be only some wicked trick on the part of the ogre,’ said she.
‘Oh, I don’t think so,’ answered the young man, ‘give her the things.’
Then the maiden was called, and she came out of her hiding place, and went up to the Jew, saying, ‘Where have you come from, Jew?’
‘From your father the ogre.’
‘And what errand did he send you on?’
‘He told me I was to give you this mirror and this comb, and to say “Look in this mirror, and comb your hair with this comb, and both will become as they were formerly.” ‘
And Dschemila took the mirror and looked into it, and combed her hair with the comb, and she had no longer an ass’s head, but the face of a beautiful maiden.
Great was the joy of both mother and cousin at this wonderful sight, and the news that Dschemila had returned soon spread, and the neighbours came flocking in with greetings.
‘When did you come back?’
‘My cousin brought me.’
‘Why, he told us he could not find you! ‘
‘Oh, I did that on purpose,’ answered Dschemil. ‘I did not want everyone to know.’
Then he turned to his father and his mother, his brothers and his sisters-in-law, and said, ‘We must set to work at once, for the wedding will be to-day.’
A beautiful litter was prepared to carry the bride to her new home, but she shrank back, saying, ‘I am afraid, lest the ogre should carry me off again.’
‘How can the ogre get at you when we are all here?’ they said. ‘There are two thousand of us all told, and every man has his sword.’
‘He will manage it somehow,’ answered Dschemila, ‘he is a powerful king!’
‘She is right,’ said an old man. ‘Take away the litter, and let her go on foot if she is afraid.’
‘But it is absurd!’ exclaimed the rest; ‘how can the ogre get hold of her?’
‘I will not go,’ said Dschemila again. ‘You do not know that monster; I do.’
And while they were disputing the bridegroom arrived.
‘Let her alone. She shall stay in her father’s house. After all, I can live here, and the wedding feast shall be made ready.’
And so they were married at last, and died without having had a single quarrel.

Once upon a time there was a man and his wife who had seven boys. The children lived in the open air and grew big and strong, and the six eldest spent part of every day hunting wild beasts. The youngest did not care so much about sport, and he often stayed with his mother.
One morning, however, as the whole seven were going out for a long expedition, they said to their aunt, ‘Dear aunt, if a baby sister comes into the world to-day, wave a white handkerchief, and we will return immediately; but if it is only a boy, just brandish a sickle, and we will go on with what we are doing.’
Now the baby when it arrived really proved to be a girl, but as the aunt could not bear the boys, she thought it was a good opportunity to get rid of them. So she waved the sickle. And when the seven brothers saw the sign they said, ‘Now we have nothing to go back for,’ and plunged deeper into the desert.
The little girl soon grew to be a big girl, and she was called by all her friends (though she did not know it) ‘Udea, who had driven her seven brothers into strange lands.’
One day, when she had been quarrelling with her playmates, the oldest among them said to her, ‘It is a pity you were born, as ever since, your brothers have been obliged to roam about the world.’
Udea did not answer, but went home to her mother and asked her, ‘Have I really got brothers?’
‘Yes,’ replied her mother, ‘seven of them. But they went away the day you were born, and I have never heard of them since.’
Then the girl said, ‘I will go and look for them till I find them.’
‘My dear child,’ answered her mother, ‘it is fifteen years since they left, and no man has seen them. How will you know which way to go?’
‘Oh, I will follow them, north and south, east and west, and though I may travel far, yet some day I will find them.’
Then her mother said no more, but gave her a camel and some food, and a negro and his wife to take care of her, and she fastened a cowrie shell round the camel’s neck for a charm, and bade her daughter go in peace.
During the first day the party journeyed on without any adventures, but the second morning the negro said to the girl, ‘Get down, and let the negress ride instead of you.’
‘Mother,’ cried Udea.
‘What is it?’ asked her mother.
‘Barka wants me to dismount from my camel.’
‘Leave her alone, Barka,’ commanded the mother, and Barka did not dare to persist.
But on the following day he said again to Udea, ‘Get down, and let the negress ride instead of you,’ and though Udea called to her mother she was too far away, and the mother never heard her. Then the negro seized her roughly and threw her on the ground, and said to his wife, ‘Climb up,’ and the negress climbed up, while the girl walked by the side. She had meant to ride all the way on her camel as her feet were bare and the stones cut them till the blood came. But she had to walk on till night, when they halted, and the next morning it was the same thing again. Weary and bleeding the poor girl began to cry, and implored the negro to let her ride, if only for a little. But he took no notice, except to bid her walk a little faster.
By-and-by they passed a caravan, and the negro stopped and asked the leader if they had come across seven young men, who were thought to be hunting somewhere about. And the man answered, ‘Go straight on, and by midday you will reach the castle where they live.’
When he heard this, the black melted some pitch in the sun, and smeared the girl with it, till she looked as much a negro as he did. Next he bade his wife get down from the camel, and told Udea to mount, which she was thankful to do. So they arrived at her brothers’ castle.
Leaving the camel kneeling at the entrance for Udea to dismount, the negro knocked loudly at the door, which was opened by the youngest brother, all the others being away hunting. He did not of course recognise Udea, but he knew the negro and his wife, and welcomed them gladly, adding, ‘But who does the other negress belong to?’
‘Oh, that is your sister!’ said they.
‘My sister! but she is coal black!’
‘That may be, but she is your sister for all that.’
The young man asked no more questions, but took them into the castle, and he himself waited outside till his brothers came home.
As soon as they were alone, the negro whispered to Udea, ‘If you dare to tell your brothers that I made you walk, or that I smeared you with pitch, I will kill you.’
‘Oh, I will be sure to say nothing,’ replied the girl, trembling, and at that moment the six elder brothers appeared in sight.
‘I have some good news for you,’ said the youngest, hastening to meet them; ‘our sister is here!’
‘Nonsense,’ they answered. ‘We have no sister; you know the child that was born was a boy.’
‘But that was not true,’ replied he, ‘and here she is with the negro and his wife. Only–she too is black,’ he added softly, but his brothers did not hear him, and pushed past joyfully.
‘How are you, good old Barka?’ they said to the negro; ‘and how comes it that we never knew that we had a sister till now?’ and they greeted Udea warmly, while she shed tears of relief and gladness.
The next morning they all agreed that they would not go out hunting. And the eldest brother took Udea on his knee, and she combed his hair and talked to him of their home till the tears ran down his cheeks and dropped on her bare arm. And where the tears fell a white mark was made. Then the brother took a cloth and rubbed the place, and he saw that she was not black at all.
‘Tell me, who painted you over like this?’ cried he.
‘I am afraid to tell you,’ sobbed the girl, ‘the negro will kill me.’
‘Afraid! and with seven brothers!’
‘Well, I will tell you then,’ she answered. ‘The negro forced me to dismount from the camel and let his wife ride instead. And the stones cut my feet till they bled and I had to bind them. And after that, when we heard your castle was near by, he took pitch and smeared my body with it.’
Then the brother rushed in wrath from the room, and seizing his sword, cut off first the negro’s head and then his wife’s. He next brought in some warm water, and washed his sister all over, till her skin was white and shining again.
‘Ah, now we see that you are our sister!’ they all said. ‘What fools the negro must have thought us, to believe for an instant that we could have a sister who was black!’ And all that day and the next they remained in the castle.
But on the third morning they said to their sister: ‘Dear sister, you must lock yourself into this castle, with only the cat for company. And be very careful never to eat anything which she does not eat too. You must be sure to give her a bit of everything. In seven days we shall be back again.’
‘All right,’ she answered, and locked herself into the castle with the cat.
On the eighth day the brothers came home. ‘How are you?’ they asked. ‘You have not been anxious?’
‘No, why should I be anxious? The gates were fast locked, and in the castle are seven doors, and the seventh is of iron. What is there to frighten me?’
‘No one will try to hurt us,’ said the brothers, ‘for they fear us greatly. But for yourself, we implore you to do nothing without consulting the cat, who has grown up in the house, and take care never to neglect her advice.’
‘All right,’ replied Udea, ‘and whatever I eat she shall have half.’
‘Capital! and if ever you are in danger the cat will come and tell us–only elves and pigeons, which fly round your window, know where to find us.’
‘This is the first I have heard of the pigeons,’ said Udea. ‘Why did you not speak of them before?’
We always leave them food and water for seven days,’ replied the brothers.
‘Ah,’ sighed the girl, ‘if I had only known, I would have given them fresh food and fresh water; for after seven days anything becomes bad. Would it not be better if I fed them every day?’
‘Much better,’ said they, ‘and we shall feel any kindnesses you do towards the cat or the pigeons exactly as if they were shown to ourselves.’
‘Set your minds at ease,’ answered the girl, ‘I will treat them as if they were my brothers.’
That night the brothers slept in the castle, but after breakfast next morning they buckled on their weapons and mounted their horses, and rode off to their hunting grounds, calling out to their sister, ‘Mind you let nobody in till we come back.’
‘Very well,’ cried she, and kept the doors carefully locked for seven days and on the eighth the brothers returned as before. Then, after spending one evening with her, they departed as soon as they had done breakfast.
Directly they were out of sight Udea began to clean the house, and among the dust she found a bean which she ate.
‘What are you eating?’ asked the cat.
‘Nothing,’ said she.
‘Open your mouth, and let me see.’ The girl did as she was told, and then the cat said ‘Why did you not give me half?’
‘I forgot,’ answered she, ‘but there are plenty of beans about, you can have as many as you like.’
‘No, that won’t do. I want half of that particular bean.’
‘But how can I give it you? I tell you I have eaten it. I can roast you a hundred others.’
‘No, I want half of that one.’
‘Oh! do as you like, only go away!’ cried she.
So the cat ran straight to the kitchen fire, and spit on it and put it out, and when Udea came to cook the supper she had nothing to light it with. ‘Why did you put the fire out?’ asked she.
‘Just to show you how nicely you would be able to cook the supper. Didn’t you tell me to do what I liked?’
The girl left the kitchen and climbed up on the roof of the castle and looked out. Far, far away, so far that she could hardly see it, was the glow of a fire. ‘I will go and fetch a burning coal from there and light my fire,’ thought she, and opened the door of the castle. When she reached the place where the fire was kindled, a hideous man-eater was crouching over it.
‘Peace be with you, grandfather,’ said she.
‘The same to you,’ replied the man-eater. ‘What brings you here, Udea?’
‘I came to ask for a lump of burning coal, to light my fire with.’
‘Do you want a big lump or a little lump?’
‘Why, what difference does it make?’ said she.
‘If you have a big lump you must give me a strip of your skin from your ear to your thumb, and if you have a little lump, you must give me a strip from your ear to your little finger.’
Udea, who thought that one sounded as bad as the other, said she would take the big lump, and when the man-eater had cut the skin, she went home again. And as she hastened on a raven beheld the blood on the ground, and plastered it with earth, and stayed by her till she reached the castle. And as she entered the door he flew past, and she shrieked from fright, for up to that moment she had not seen him. In her terror she called after him. ‘May you get the same start as you have given me!’
‘Why should you wish me harm,’ asked the raven pausing in his flight, ‘when I have done you a service?’
‘What service have you done me?’ said she.
‘Oh, you shall soon see,’ replied the raven, and with his bill he scraped away all the earth he had smeared over the blood and then flew away.
In the night the man-eater got up, and followed the blood till he came to Udea’s castle. He entered through the gate which she had left open, and went on till he reached the inside of the house. But here he was stopped by the seven doors, six of wood and one of iron, and all fast locked. And he called through them ‘Oh Udea, what did you see your grandfather doing?’
‘I saw him spread silk under him, and silk over him, and lay himself down in a four-post bed.’
When he heard that, the man-eater broke in one door, and laughed and went away.
And the second night he came back, and asked her again what she had seen her grandfather doing, and she answered him as before, and he broke in another door, and laughed and went away, and so each night till he reached the seventh door. Then the maiden wrote a letter to her brothers, and bound it round the neck of a pigeon, and said to it, ‘Oh, thou pigeon that served my father and my grandfather, carry this letter to my brothers, and come back at once.’ And the pigeon flew away.
It flew and it flew and it flew till it found the brothers. The eldest unfastened the letter from the pigeon’s neck, and read what his sister had written: ‘I am in a great strait, my brothers. If you do not rescue me to-night, to-morrow I shall be no longer living, for the man-eater has broken open six doors, and only the iron door is left. So haste, haste, post haste.’
‘Quick, quick! my brothers,’ cried he.
‘What is the matter?’ asked they.
‘If we cannot reach our sister to-night, to-morrow she will be the prey of the man-eater.’
And without more words they sprang on their horses, and rode like the wind.
The gate of the castle was thrown down, and they entered the court and called loudly to their sister. But the poor girl was so ill with fear and anxiety that she could not even speak. Then the brothers dismounted and passed through the six open doors, till they stood before the iron one, which was still shut. ‘Udea, open!’ they cried, ‘it is only your brothers!’ And she arose and unlocked the door, and throwing herself on the neck of the eldest burst into tears.
‘Tell us what has happened,’ he said, ‘and how the man- eater traced you here.’ ‘It is all the cat’s fault,’ replied Udea. ‘She put out my fire so that I could not cook. All about a bean! I ate one and forgot to give her any of it.’
‘But we told you so particularly,’ said the eldest brother, ‘never to eat anything without sharing it with the cat.’
‘Yes, but I tell you I forgot,’ answered Udea.
‘Does the man-eater come here every night?’ asked the brothers.
‘Every night,’ said Udea, ‘and he breaks one door in and then goes away.’
Then all the brothers cried together, ‘We will dig a great hole, and fill it with burning wood, and spread a covering over the top; and when the man-eater arrives we will push him into it.’ So they all set to work and prepared the great hole, and set fire to the wood, till it was reduced to a mass of glowing charcoal. And when the man-eater came, and called as usual, ‘Udea, what did you see your grandfather doing?’ she answered, ‘I saw him pull off the ass’ skin and devour the ass, and he fell in the fire, and the fire burned him up.’
Then the man-eater was filled with rage, and he flung himself upon the iron door and burst it in. On the other side stood Udea’s seven brothers, who said, ‘Come, rest yourself a little on this mat.’ And the man-eater sat down, and he fell right into the burning pit which was under the mat, and they heaped on more wood, till nothing was left of him, not even a bone. Only one of his finger-nails was blown away, and fell into an upper chamber where Udea was standing, and stuck under one of the nails of her own fingers. And she sank lifeless to the earth.
Meanwhile her brothers sat below waiting for her and wondering why she did not come. ‘What can have happened to her!’ exclaimed the eldest brother. ‘Perhaps she has fallen into the fire, too.’ So one of the others ran upstairs and found his sister stretched on the floor. ‘Udea! Udea!’ he cried, but she did not move or reply. Then he saw that she was dead, and rushed down to his brothers in the courtyard and called out, ‘Come quickly, our sister is dead!’ In a moment they were all beside her and knew that it was true, and they made a bier and laid her on it, and placed her across a camel, and said to the camel, ‘Take her to her mother, but be careful not to halt by the way, and let no man capture you, and see you kneel down before no man, save him who shall say “string” [Footnote: ‘Riemen.’] to you. But to him who says “string,” then kneel.’
So the camel started, and when it had accomplished half its journey it met three men, who ran after it in order to catch it; but they could not. Then they cried ‘Stop!’ but the camel only went the faster. The three men panted behind till one said to the others, ‘Wait a minute! The string of my sandal is broken!’ The camel caught the word ‘string’ and knelt down at once, and the men came up and found a dead girl lying on a bier, with a ring on her finger. And as one of the young men took hold of her hand to pull off the ring, he knocked out the man-eater’s finger-nail, which had stuck there, and the maiden sat up and said, ‘Let him live who gave me life, and slay him who slew me!’ And when the camel heard the maiden speak, it turned and carried her back to her brothers.
Now the brothers were still seated in the court bewailing their sister, and their eyes were dim with weeping so that they could hardly see. And when the camel stood before them they said, ‘Perhaps it has brought back our sister!’ and rose to give it a beating. But the camel knelt down and the girl dismounted, and they flung themselves on her neck and wept more than ever for gladness.
‘Tell me,’ said the eldest, as soon as he could speak, ‘how it all came about, and what killed you.’
‘I was waiting in the upper chamber,’ said she, ‘and a nail of the man-eater’s stuck under my nail, and I fell dead upon the ground. That is all I know.’
‘But who pulled out the nail?’ asked he.
‘A man took hold of my hand and tried to pull off my ring, and the nail jumped out and I was alive again. And when the camel heard me say “Let him live who gave me life, slay him who slew me!” it turned and brought me back to the castle. That is my story.’
She was silent and the eldest brother spoke. ‘Will you listen to what I have to say, my brothers?’
And they replied, ‘How should we not hear you? Are you not our father as well as our brother?’
‘Then this is my advice. Let us take our sister back to our father and mother, that we may see them once more before they die.’
And the young men agreed, and they mounted their horses and placed their sister in a litter on the camel. So they set out.
At the end of five days’ journey they reached the old home where their father and mother dwelt alone. And the heart of their father rejoiced, and he said to them, ‘Dear sons, why did you go away and leave your mother and me to weep for you night and day?’
‘Dear father,’ answered the son, ‘let us rest a little now, and then I will tell you everything from the beginning.’
‘All right,’ replied the father, and waited patiently for three days.
And on the morning of the fourth day the eldest brother said, ‘Dear father, would you like to hear our adventures?’
‘Certainly I should!’
‘Well, it was our aunt who was the cause of our leaving home, for we agreed that if the baby was a sister she should wave a white handkerchief, and if it was a brother, she should brandish a sickle, for then there would be nothing to come back for, and we might wander far away. Now our aunt could not bear us, and hated us to live in the same house with her, so she brandished the sickle, and we went away. That is all our story.’
And that is all this story.

“Yes, my baasjes,sowas Oom Jakhals: he always made as if he forgot all about what he had done, and he made as if he thought all the others forgot too, quick-quick. He is maar so schelm.”
Here Outa took full advantage of the pinch of snuff he held between his right forefinger and thumb, sneezed with evident enjoyment two or three times, and continued:
“When Jakhals thought Hyena was quite well, he went to visit her.
“‘It’s very dull here in the veld,’ he said, ‘and food is so scarce, so I’m going to hire myself to a farmer. He’ll give me lots to eat and drink, and when I’m nice and fat I’ll come home again. Would you like to go too, Brown Sister?’
“Hyena smacked her lips when she heard about the nice things to eat. She thought it a very good plan. So they went to a farm, and Jakhals talked so nicely that the farmer hired them both to work for him.
“Ach! it was a beautiful place; lots of chickens and little ducks, and Afrikander sheep with large fat tails that could be melted out for soap and candles, and eggs, and doves and pigeons—all things that Jakhals liked. He just felt in his stomach that he was going to have a jolly life.
“During the day Jakhals peeped all about, in this corner, in that corner, and he found out where the farmer kept the nice fat that was melted out of the sheep’s tails. In the middle of the night, when all the people were fast asleep, he got up and went quietly, my baasjes, quietly, like a shadow on the ground, to the place where the fat was. He took a big lump and smeared it all over Brown Sister’s tail while she was asleep. Then he ate all that was left—n-yum, n-yum, n-yum—and went to sleep in the waggon-house.
“Early in the morning, when the farmer went out to milk the cows, he missed the fat.
“‘Lieve land! Where is all my fat?’ he said. ‘It must be that vagabond Jakhals. But wait, I’ll get him!’
“He took a thick riem and his sjambok, and went to the waggon-house to catch Jakhals and give him a beating. But when he asked about the fat, Jakhals spoke in a little, little voice.
“‘Ach no, Baas! Would I then do such an ugly thing? And look at my tail. There’s no fat on it. The one whose tail is full of fat is the thief.’
“He turned round and waved his tail in the farmer’s face, and anyone could easily see that there was no fat on it.
“‘But the fat is gone,’ said the farmer, ‘someonemust have stolen it,’ and he went on hunting, hunting in the waggon-house.
“At last he came to where Hyena was sleeping, just like a baby, baasjes, so nicely, and snoring a little: not the loud snoring like sawing planks—gorr-korrr, gorr-korr—but nice soft snoring like people do when they sleep very fast—see-uw, see-uw. It is the deepest sleep when a person snores see-uw, see-uw. Hyena’s head was on some chaff, and her tail was sticking out behind her, stiff with fat!
“‘Aha! here is the thief,’ said the farmer, and he began to tie the riem round her.
“Old Brown Sister sat up and rubbed her eyes. ‘What’s the matter?’ she asked. ‘I had a beautiful dream. I dreamt I was eating fat the whole night, and——’
“‘And so you were—myfat,’ said the farmer, and he pulled the rope tighter. ‘And now I’m going to teach you not to steal again.’
“Poor old Brown Sister jumped about when she found out what he was going to do; she ran round and round the waggon-house trying to get away; she called out, and she called out that she did not know about the fat, that she had never tasted it, and had never even seen it. But it was no good.
“‘Look at your tail,’ said the farmer. ‘Will you tell me that your tail went by itself and rubbed itself in the fat?’
“So he tied her to the waggon wheel and beat her, and beat her—ach! she was quite sore—and she screamed and screamed, and at last he drove her away from the farm.
“Poor old Brown Sister! She didn’t even have the fat from her tail to eat, because, baasjes see, with the running round and the beating, it was all rubbed off. But she never went to live on a farm again; the veld was quite good enough for her.”
“Is that the end, Outa?” asked Willem.
“Yes, my baasje. It’s a bad end, but Outa can’t help it. It does maar end so.”
“And where was Jakhals all the time?” enquired Pietie, severely.
“Jakhals, my baasje, was sitting on the waggon saying his prayers—so, my baasjes.” Outa put his crooked hands together and cast his twinkling eyes upwards till only the yellows showed.
“‘Bezie, bezie, brame,
Hou jouw handjes same.’
In English: “Berry, berry, blackberry,
Hold your hands together.”
“And every time Hyena screamed, Jakhals begged her not to steal again, but to try and behave like a good Christian.”
“ButJakhalswas the thief,” said little Jan, indignantly. “He was always the wicked one, and he was never punished. How was that, Outa?”
A whimsical smile played over the old man’s face, and though his eyes danced as wickedly as ever, his voice was sober as he answered.
“Ach! my little master, how can Outa tell? It is maar so in this old world. It’s like the funny thing Baas Willem saw in the Kaap (Cape Town),that runs down a place so quickly that it just runs up on the other side, andthenit can’t stop, but it has to run down again, and so it keeps on—up and down, up and down.”
“You mean the switchback?” asked Willem.
“Ach, yes! baasje, Outa means so. And in the world it is the same—up and down, up and down. And often the good ones are down and the bad ones are up. But the thing—Outa can’t get the name right—goes on, and it goes on, and by-and-by the good ones are up and the bad ones are down.”
“But Jakhals seemed always to be up,” remarked Willem.
“Yes, my baasje,” said the old man, soberly. “Jakhals seemed always to be up. It goes so sometimes, it goes so,” but his eyes suddenly had a far-away look, and one could not be certain that he was thinking of Jakhals.

“It was Tante Hyena that Jakhals cheated more than anyone,” said Outa. “She always forgot about the last time he had played a trick on her, so she was quite ready to believe him when he came along with another story. Some peopleareso, my baasjes. P’raps it’s kindness, p’raps it’s only stupidness; Outa doesn’t know.
“One day Jakhals and Hyena were out walking together when a white cloud came up behind the kopjes and floated over the veld quite close to them. It was a nice thick cloud, just like white fat, and Jakhals climbed on to it and sat looking down over the edge. Then he bit pieces out of it, and ate them.
“‘Arré! but this white fat is nice,’ he said. ’N-yum, n-yum, n-yum,’ and he chewed round the cloud like a caterpillar chews a leaf.
“Hyena licked her lips and looked up at him.
“‘Throw me down some, please,’ she said.
“‘Ach! my Brown Sister, will I then be so greedy as to throw you down little bits? Wait till I get down, and then I’ll help you up to eat for yourself. But come a little nearer so that you can catch me when I jump.’
“So Hyena stood ready, and Jakhals jumped in such a way that he knocked her into the sand. He fell soft, because he was on top, but foei! poor Hyena had all the breath knocked out of her and she was covered with dust.
“‘Ach! but I am clumsy!’ said Jakhals; ‘but never mind, now I’ll help you.’
“So when she had got up and dusted herself, he helped her to climb on to the cloud. There she sat, biting pieces off and eating them, ‘N-yum, n-yum, n-yum, it’s just like white fat!’
“After a time she called out, ‘Grey Brother, I’ve had enough. I want to come down. Please catch me when I jump.’
“‘Ach, certainly Brown Sister, come on. Just see how nicely I’ll catch you. So-o-o.’
“He held out his arms, but just as Hyena jumped he sprang to one side, calling out, ‘Ola! Ola! a thorn has pricked me. What shall I do? what shall I do?’ and he hopped about holding one leg up.
“Woops! Down fell Brown Sister, and as she fell she put out her left leg to save herself, but it doubled up under her and was nearly broken. She lay in a bundle in the sand, crying, ‘My leg is cracked! my leg is cracked!’
“Jakhals came along very slowly—jump, jump, on three legs. Surely the thorn, that wasn’t there, was hurting him very much!
“‘Oo! oo!’ cried Hyena, ‘help me up, Grey Brother. My leg is broken.’
“‘And mine has a thorn in it. Foei toch, my poor sister! How can the sick help the sick? The only plan is for us to get home in the best way we can. Good-bye, and I will visit you to-morrow to see if you are all right.’
“And off he went—jump, jump, on three legs—very slowly; but as soon as Old Brown Sister could not see him, he put down the other one and—sh-h-h-h—he shot over the veld and got home just in time to have a nice supper of young ducks that Mrs. Jakhals and the children had caught at Oubaas van Niekerk’s dam.
“But poor Brown Sister lay in the sand crying over her sore places, and from that day she walks lame, because her left hind foot is smaller than the right one.”1

“Once upon a time,” began Outa Karel, and his audience of three looked up expectantly.
“Once upon a time, Oom Leeuw roared and the forest shook with the dreadful sound. Then, from far away over the vlakte, floated another roar, and the little lion cubs jumped about and stood on their heads, tumbling over each other in their merriment.
“‘Hear,’ they said, ‘it is Volstruis, old Three Sticks. He tries to imitate the King, our father. He roars well. Truly there is no difference.’
“When Leeuw heard this he was very angry, so he roared again, louder than ever. Again came back the sound over the veld, as if it had been an echo.
“‘Ach, no! this will never do,’ thought Leeuw. ‘I must put a stop to this impudence. I alone am King here, and imitators—I want none.’
“So he went forth and roamed over the vlakte till he met old Three Sticks, the Ostrich. They stood glaring at each other.
“Leeuw’s eyes flamed, his mane rose in a huge mass and he lashed his tail angrily. Volstruis spread out his beautiful wings and swayed from side to side, his beak open and his neck twisting like a whip-snake. Ach! it was pretty, but if baasjes could have seen his eyes! Baasjes know, Volstruis’s eyes are very soft and beautiful—like Nonnie’s when she tells the Bible stories; but now there was only fierceness in them, and yellow lights that looked like fire.
“But there was no fight—yet. It was only their way of meeting. Leeuw came a step nearer and said, ‘We must see who is baas. You, Volstruis, please to roar a little.’
“So Volstruis roared, blowing out his throat, so, ‘Hoo-hoo-hoor-r-r-r!’ It was a fearsome sound—the sort of sound that makes you feel streams of cold water running down your back when you hear it suddenly and don’t know what it is. Yes, baasjes, if you are in bed you curl up and pull the blankets over your head, and if you are outside you run in and get close to the Nooi or Nonnie.”
A slight movement, indicative of contradiction, passed from one to another of his small hearers, but—unless it was a free and easy, conversational evening—they made it a point of honour never to interrupt Outa in full career. This, like other things, could await the finish of the story.
“Then Leeuw roared, and truly the voices were the same. No one could say, ‘This is a bigger voice,’ or ‘That is a more terrifying voice.’ No, they were just equal.
“So Leeuw said to Volstruis, ‘Our voices are alike. You are my equal in roaring. Let it then be so. You will be King of the Birds as I am King of the Beasts. Now let us go hunting and see who is baas there.’
“Out in the vlakte some sassaby were feeding, big fat ones, a nice klompje; so Leeuw started off in one direction and Volstruis in the other, but both kept away from the side the wind came from. Wild bucks can smell—ach toch! so good. Just one little puff when a hunter is creeping up to them, and at once all the heads are in the air—sniff, sniff, sniff—and they are off like the wind. Dust is all you see, and when that has blown away—ach no! there are no bucks; the whole veld is empty, empty!”
Outa stretched out his arms and waved them from side to side with an exaggerated expression of finding nothing but empty space, his voice mournful with a sense of irreparable loss.
“But”—he took up his tale with renewed energy—“Leeuw and Volstruis were old hunters. They knew how to get nearer and nearer without letting the bucks know. Leeuw trailed himself along slowly, slowly, close to the ground, and only when he was moving could you see which was Leeuw and which was sand: the colour was just the same.
“He picked out a big buck, well-grown and fat, but not too old to be juicy, and when he got near enough he hunched himself up very quietly—so, my little masters, just so—ready to spring, and then before you could whistle, he shot through the air like a stone from a catapult, and fell, fair and square, on to the sassaby’s back, his great tearing claws fastened on its shoulders and his wicked teeth meeting in the poor thing’s neck.
“Ach! the beautiful big buck! Never again would his pointed horns tear open his enemies! Never again would he lead the herd, or pronk in the veld in mating time! Never again would his soft nostrils scent danger in the distance, nor his quick hoofs give the signal for the stampede! No, it was really all up with him this time! When Oom Leeuw gets hold of a thing, he doesn’t let go till it is dead.
“The rest of the herd—ach, but they ran! Soon they were far away, only specks in the distance; all except those that Volstruis had killed. Truly Volstruis was clever! Baasjes know, he can run fast—faster even than the sassaby. So when he saw Leeuw getting ready to spring, he raced up-wind as hard as he could, knowing that was what the herd would do. So there he was waiting for them, and didn’t he play with them! See, baasjes, he stood just so”—in his excitement Outa rose and struck an attitude—“and when they streaked past him he jumped like this, striking at them with the hard, sharp claws on his old two toes.” Outa hopped about like a fighting bantam, while the children hugged themselves in silent delight.
“Voerts! there was one dead!”—Outa kicked to the right. “Voerts! there was another!”—he kicked to the left—“till there was a klomp of bucks lying about the veld giving their last blare. Yes, old Two Toes did his work well that day.
“When Leeuw came up and saw that Volstruis had killed more than he had, he was not very pleased, but Volstruis soon made it all right.
“Leeuw said, ‘You have killed most, so you rip open and begin to eat.’
“‘Oh no!’ said Volstruis, ‘you have cubs to share the food with, so you rip open and eat. I shall only drink the blood.’
“This put Leeuw in a good humour; he thought Volstruis a noble, unselfish creature. But truly, as I said before, Volstruis was clever. Baasjes see, he couldn’t eat meat; he had no teeth. But he didn’t want Leeuw to know. Therefore he said, ‘You eat; I will only drink the blood.’
“So Leeuw ripped open—sk-r-r-r-r, sk-r-r-r-r—and called the cubs, and they all ate till they were satisfied. Then Volstruis came along in a careless fashion, pecking, pecking as he walked, and drank the blood. Then he and Leeuw lay down in the shade of some trees and went to sleep.
“The cubs played about, rolling and tumbling over each other. As they played they came to the place where Volstruis lay.
“‘Aha!’ said one, ‘he sleeps with his mouth open.’
“He peeped into Volstruis’s mouth. ‘Aha!’ he said again, ‘I see something.’
“Another cub came and peeped.
“‘Alle kracht!’ he said, ‘I see something too. Let us go and tell our father.’
“So they ran off in great excitement and woke Leeuw. ‘Come, come quickly,’ they said. ‘Volstruis insults you by saying he is your equal. He lies sleeping under the trees with his mouth wide open, and we have peeped into it, and behold,he has no teeth! Come and see for yourself.’
“Leeuw bounded off quick-quick with the cubs at his tail.
“‘Nier-r-r-r,’ he growled, waking Volstruis, ‘nier-r-r-r. What is the meaning of this? You pretend you are my equal, and you haven’t even got teeth.’
“‘Teeth or no teeth,’ said Volstruis, standing up wide awake, ‘I killed more bucks than you did to-day. Teeth or no teeth, I’ll fight you to show who’s baas.’
“‘Come on,’ said Leeuw. ‘Who’s afraid? I’m just ready for you. Come on!’
“‘No, wait a little,’ said Volstruis. ‘I’ve got a plan. You see that ant-heap over there? Well, you stand on one side of it, and I’ll stand on the other side, and we’ll see who can push it over first. After that we’ll come out into the open and fight.’
“‘That seems an all-right plan,’ said Leeuw; and he thought to himself, ‘I’m heavier and stronger; I can easily send the ant-heap flying on to old Three Sticks, and then spring over and kill him.’
“But wait a bit! It was not as easy as he thought. Every time he sprang at the ant-heap he clung to it as he was accustomed to cling to his prey. He had no other way of doing things. And then Volstruis would take the opportunity of kicking high into the air, sending the sand and stones into Leeuw’s face, and making him howl and splutter with rage.
“Sometimes he would stand still and roar, and Volstruis would send a roar back from the other side.
“So they went on till the top of the ant-heap was quite loosened by the kicks and blows. Leeuw was getting angrier and angrier, and he could hardly see—his eyes were so full of dust. He gathered himself together for a tremendous spring, but, before he could make it, Volstruis bounded into the air and kicked the whole top off the ant-heap. Arré, but the dust was thick!
“When it cleared away, there lay Leeuw, groaning and coughing, with the great heap of earth and stones on top of him.
“‘Ohé! ohé!’ wailed the cubs, ‘get up, my father. Here he comes, the Toothless One! He who has teeth only on his feet! Get up and slay him.’
“Leeuw shook himself free of the earth and sprang at Volstruis, but his eyes were full of sand; he could not see properly, so he missed. As he came down heavily, Volstruis shot out his strong right leg and caught Leeuw in the side. Sk-r-r-r-r! went the skin, and goops! goops! over fell poor Oom Leeuw, with Volstruis’s terrible claws—the teeth of old Two Toes—fastened into him.
“Volstruis danced on him, flapping and waving his beautiful black and white wings, and tearing the life out of Oom Leeuw.
“When it was all over, he cleaned his claws in the sand and waltzed away slowly over the veld to where his mate sat on the nest.
“Only the cubs were left wailing over the dead King of the Forest.”
The usual babel of question and comment broke out at the close of the story, till at last Pietie’s decided young voice detached itself from the general chatter.
“Outa, what made you say that about pulling the blankets over one’s head and running to get near Mammie if one heard Volstruis bellowing at night? You know quite well that none ofuswould ever do it.”
“Yes, yes, my baasje, I know,” said Outa, soothingly. “I never meant anyone who belongs to the land of Volstruise. But other little masters, who did not know the voice of old Three Sticks—they would run to their mam-mas if they heard him.”
“Oh, I see,” said Pietie, accepting the apology graciously. “I was sure you could not mean a karroo farm boy.”
“Is your story a parable, Outa?” asked little Jan, who had been doing some hard thinking for the last minute.
“Ach! and what is that, my little master?”
“A kind of fable, Outa.”
“Yes, that’s what it is, baasje,” said Outa, gladly seizing on the word he understood, “a fable, a sort of nice little fable.”
“But a parable is an earthly story with a heavenly meaning, and when Cousin Minnie tells us parables she always finds the meaning for us. What is the heavenly meaning of this, Outa?”
Little Jan’s innocent grey eyes were earnestly fixed on Outa’s face, as though to read from it the explanation he sought. For once the old native was nonplussed. He rubbed his red kopdoek, laid a crooked finger thoughtfully against his flat nose, scratched his sides, monkey-fashion, and finally had recourse once more to the kopdoek. But all these expedients failed to inspire him with the heavenly meaning of the story he had just told. Ach! these dear little ones, to think of such strange things! There they all were, waiting for his next words. He must get out of it somehow.
“Baasjes,” he began, smoothly, “there is abeautifulmeaning to the story, but Outa hasn’t got time to tell it now. Another time——”
“Outa,” broke in Willem, reprovingly, “youknowyou only want to get away so that you can go to the old tramp-floor, where the volk are dancing to-night.”
“No, my baasje, truly no!”
“And I wouldn’t be surprised to hear that you had danced, too, after the way you have been jumping about here.”
“Yes, that was fine,” said Pietie, with relish. “‘Voerts! there is one dead! Voerts! there is another!’ Outa, you always say you are so stiff, but you can still kick well.”
“Aja, baasje,” returned Outa, modestly; “in my day I was a great dancer. No one could do the Vastrap better—and the Hondekrap—and the Valsrivier. Arré, those were the times!”
He gave a little hop at the remembrance of those mad and merry days, and yet another and another, always towards the passage leading to the kitchen.
“But the meaning, Outa, the heavenly meaning!” cried little Jan. “You haven’t told us.”
“No, my little baas, not to-night. Ask the Nonnie; she will tell you. Here she comes.”
And as Cousin Minnie entered the room, the wily old native, with an agility not to be expected from his cramped and crooked limbs, skipped away, leaving her to bear the brunt of his inability to explain his own story.

His name was Mamad. Mamad was famous all over the land, far and wide, for his reputation of always telling the truth. The king heard about Mamad and ordered his subjects to bring him to the palace. He looked at the wise man and asked: 'Mamad, is it true, that you have never lied?' 'It's true.' 'And you will never lie in your life?' 'I will never lie in my life.' 'Okay, tell the truth, but be careful! Lies are cunning! They get on your tongue easily.' Several days passed and the king called Mamad once again. The king was determined to trick Mamad into lying. With a big crowd gathered all around, the king talked with Mamad as he prepared to go hunting. With one foot in his horse's stirrup, he ordered Mamad: 'Go to my summer palace and tell the queen I will be with her for lunch. Tell her to prepare a big feast. You will have lunch with me then.' Mamad bowed down to the king and then set off to find the queen. The king laughed and said: 'We won't go hunting and now Mamad will lie to the queen. Tomorrow we will laugh on his behalf.' But the wise Mamad went to the palace and said: 'Maybe you should prepare a big feast for lunch tomorrow, and maybe you shouldn't. Maybe the king will come by noon, and maybe he won't.' 'Tell me will he come, or won't he?' asked the queen. 'I don't know whether he got on his horse or whether he put his left foot on the ground after I left.' Everybody waited for the king. He came the next day and said to the queen: 'The wise Mamad, who never lies, lied to you yesterday.' But the queen told him about the words of Mamad. The king realized that the wise man never lies, and says only that, which he saw with his own eyes.",English,Africa,rania

'You know, cleverness is a very important thing to own! Why, cleverness has helped Nogwaja out of the cooking pot more than once!' 'The Jackal is also a clever animal, isn't he, Gogo?' asked little Sipho (see' poh), who was quite proud that his nickname was Mpungushe (mpoo-ngoo'-shay = 'jackal'). Gogo, in fact, had given him that name because of the loud howl he had made as a baby. Sipho liked to think it was because he was quick and agile as the Jackal. Gogo laughed and looked at the child at her feet. 'Yes, my boy! You are right! Jackal is a very clever animal. Sometimes too clever for his own good!' 'I remember how he helped Jabu the herdboy by tricking Bhubesi back into the snare. Tell us another tale about Jackal, Gogo!' begged Sipho. 'Yes, Gogo,' her other grandchildren chorused. 'Please tell us....' 'Alright, my children. But listen and learn!' Gogo settled her round self down more comfortably upon the tree stump. 'Kwasuka sukela . . .' One day long ago, Jackal was trotting through a narrow, rocky pass. As he often did, he kept his nose to the ground as he ambled along, to catch the odd scent. 'Never know when I'll happen upon my next meal,' he thought to himself, although it was highly unlikely that he would find a rat out in the midday heat. But perhaps he could catch a lizard or two. Suddenly he was aware of a movement ahead of him in the pass. 'Oh, no!' Jackal moaned and stopped dead-still in his tracks. Lion was coming toward him. Realising that he was too near to escape, Jackal was filled with fear. He had played so many tricks on the great Bhubesi in the past, he was sure that lion would take this opportunity to get his revenge. In a flash Jackal thought of a plan. 'Help! Help!' cried Jackal. He cowered down on the cliff path, looking above at the rocks. Lion stopped short in surprise. 'Help!' Jackal howled, using the fear he felt in the middle of his chest to accentuate his cry. Jackal glanced up at Bhubesi. 'Oh, great Nkosi! Help! There is no time to lose! See those great rocks above us? They are about to fall! We shall both be crushed to death!!!! Oh, mighty Lion, do something! Save us!' And Jackal cowered even lower, his paws covering his head. Lion looked up, most alarmed. Before he even had a chance to think, Jackal was begging him to use his strength to hold up the overhanging rock. So Lion put his brawny shoulder to the rock and heaved. 'Oh, thank you, great King!' yelped Jackal. 'I will quickly fetch that log over there to prop under the rock, and we will both be saved!' With that Jackal bounded out of sight. Lion was left all alone to struggle under the weight of the unmoving rock. How long he remained there before he realized that it was another trick, we will never know. But this much we do know: Jackal continued to live by his wits!",English,Africa,rania

Banta et la tortue qui chante
Pays de collecte : Mali.
Un conte dit en français et en bambara par Ousmane Diarra.
Auteur : Ousmane Diarra (recueilli par Eric Chevillard).
Banta était le chasseur le plus redoutable de la savane. Tout animal qui passait à portée de sa
lance pouvait se considérer comme mort, dépouillé et rôti. Banta faisait fi de l’ancienne
croyance selon laquelle l’homme qui tue une femelle gravide ou accompagnée de son petit
périra lui-même sans descendance. Au demeurant, Banta était père de trois beaux enfants.
Chaque soir, il rentrait chez lui chargé de gibier, portant, autour de son cou, des renards et des
écureuils, dans les sacs attachés à sa ceinture, des lièvres et des pigeons, et tirant par les pieds
un zèbre ou une antilope. Il tuait plus que lui et les siens ne pouvaient manger par goût du sang
et du meurtre, pour le seul plaisir de tuer. Banta aimait aussi à se vanter et nul ne pouvait le
faire taire lorsqu’il se lançait dans le récit de ses carnages.
Aujourd’hui, les animaux de la brousse se réunissent sous un manguier pour tenir conseil. Il est
temps de réagir et de mettre hors d’état de nuire cet exterminateur avant que tous ne
succombent, frappés par sa lance ou étranglés par ses collets. Mais qui osera affronter Banta le
chasseur ? Le lion baisse la tête, très intéressé tout à coup par une fourmi qui passe entre ses
pattes. Le rhinocéros a justement à faire ailleurs, un rendez-vous de la plus haute importance
pour sa carrière de rhinocéros et l’éléphant se sent bien faible. Il n’est pas le seul malade.
- Moi aussi j’ai dû attraper froid, dit le serpent.
Quant au charognard, il aura sans doute mangé de la viande trop fraîche.
En somme, nul n’est assez fou pour défier Banta le chasseur. Le carnage va continuer. Le sang
des animaux de la savane coulera jusqu’à la dernière goutte. C’est alors qu’une toute petite
tortue se porte volontaire. Elle demande seulement aux autres animaux de rester cachés le
lendemain, de ne quitter sous aucun prétexte leurs gîtes, leurs terriers, leurs tanières.
Banta bat les buissons avec un bâton, il soulève chaque pierre, puis il renverse la tête et fixe
éperdument le ciel vide. Jamais la savane n’avait été si calme. En vain cherche-t-il des
empreintes dans le sable ou la poussière. Pas un souffle de vie, pas un bruit d’aile. Pas un
crocodile dans les marigots. Le soir venu, bredouille pour la première fois, Banta se résigne à
prendre le chemin du retour, le cœur empli de colère et d’amertume.
Il n’a pas rêvé. Il a bien entendu les notes claires d’une kora, d’abord, puis un chant mélodieux
semble provenir de ce bouquet de hautes herbes. Intrigué, Banta s’approche prudemment :
c’est une toute petite tortue qui chante en pinçant avec allégresse les cordes de son instrument.
Voilà qui amusera mes enfants, se dit Banta, et fera peut-être oublier l’insuccès de ma chasse. Et
il fourre la tortue dans un sac.
- Tu ne ramènes donc pas de gibier ? s’écrie son fils en le voyant entrer dans la cour de la
concession.
- J’ai mieux, répond Banta. Grâce à ma ruse et à mon adresse, j’ai capturé une tortue qui chante.
Écoutez-la.
Et devant la famille et les voisins réunis, la tortue docilement se met à jouer de son instrument
et à chanter. Banta reçoit les applaudissements comme s’ils lui étaient adressés.
- Je tiens avec cette tortue une belle occasion de briller devant le roi, pense-t-il.",French,Mali,amine

Le lendemain, il se présente au palais et demande audience.
- J’ai dressé cette petite tortue à chanter pour vous, noble roi.
- Reviens ce soir. Elle chantera devant la cour.
Et voici la cour rassemblée. Banta tient dans ses mains la tortue prodigieuse. Avec un sourire de
triomphe, il l’installe sur un tabouret et pose sa kora devant elle.
- Vas-y, chante.
Mais la tortue reste muette.
- Chante, allez !
Mais la tortue reste muette.
- Chante, allez !
Mais la tortue lentement rétracte sa tête et ses pattes dans sa carapace. « Honte sur Banta »,
crache le roi qui n’apprécie guère que l’on se moque de lui et ordonne l’exécution du fanfaron.
Une potence est dressée sur-le-champ.
Voici Banta à son tour pris au collet. Il suffoque et se débat, inexorablement, il meurt. Et comme
une ultime convulsion tord son corps supplicié. Dans le silence funèbre, une kora soudain
égrène quelques notes cristallines. Puis, une petite voix entonne un chant étrange et gai, tandis
que Banta grimaçant rend son dernier soupir.",French,Mali,amine

Comment le lion devint roi
Pays de collecte : Mali.
Un conte dit en français et en bambara par Ousmane Diarra.
Auteur : Ousmane Diarra.
Le lion n'était pas le roi des animaux. Du moins, il ne l'était pas au départ. C'était plutôt Dankélé,
un grand buffle noir de la savane, qui régnait sur le peuple des bêtes. Le roi Dankélé était un
grand tyran, un roi qui gouvernait sans foi ni loi. Que tu aies raison, tu avais peur. Que tu n’aies
pas raison, tu avais raison d’avoir peur devant lui.
À cette époque, il y avait une seule rivière à laquelle tous les animaux venaient boire, mais
personne n’avait le droit de boire avant Dankélé. Et Dankélé ne se contentait pas seulement de
se désaltérer, il se baignait dans la rivière, s'y roulait et y faisait tous ses besoins. C'est après que
les autres pouvaient boire à leur tour l'eau déjà souillée.
C'était injuste, mais c'était comme ça. Il fallait le supporter.
Mais la lionne mère, ce jour-là, ne put attendre l’arrivée du roi. Son lionceau qui venait d’arriver
au monde, allait mourir de soif. Elle lui donna un peu d’eau. Elle en but un tout petit peu, elle-
même.
Arriva le roi Dankélé. Il était accompagné des membres de sa cour, des griots et des griottes qui
chantaient ses louanges :
« Ô ! Grand buffle !
Tu es plus grand que Soundjata le grand
Plus grand que Da Monzon le grand
Plus grand qu’Alexandre le grand ! »
Mais le roi Dankélé, quand il fut au bord de la rivière, vit qu’on avait osé boire avant lui, le roi. Il
se tourna vers son peuple et les menaçant de son regard, hurla sa colère. Et sa colère fit
trembler tout le monde :
- Qui est-ce… Mais qui est-ce qui a donc osé boire avant moi le roi ? Si vous ne me désignez pas
le coupable, vous l’êtes tous !
Les animaux, terrifiés, se regardèrent dans les yeux. Tout le monde avait vu la lionne donner à
boire à son petit. Mais qui pouvait prendre la responsabilité de la dénoncer à cette brute de
roi ? L’hyène le fit :
- Moi, je ne vais pas payer pour une faute que je n'ai pas commise. C'est la lionne qui a bu avant
toi. Voilà, j'ai dit.
Et aussitôt, d'un bond, le roi Dankélé écrasa la lionne avec ses grosses pattes.
Mais le lionceau n’était pas mort. Il s’est sauvé à toutes pattes et est allé se cacher. Il a attendu,
attendu jusqu'à ce qu’il soit devenu grand. Quand il est devenu un grand lion dont le
rugissement retentissait à travers toute la savane, il est sorti et il a dit au buffle :
- Buffle où est partie ma mère ?
Le buffle intimidé par la force que dégageait le lion, bafouille :
- Ta, ta, ta mère la lionne.",French,Mali,amine

Un conseiller lui souffle à l’oreille :
- Il s’agit de la lionne que tu as tuée il y a de cela quelques années parce qu’elle avait osé boire
avant toi.
- Ah oui c’est vrai, dit le buffle en se tournant vers le lion. C’est la loi, ce n’est pas moi. La loi,
c’est la loi. Ta maman a osé boire avant moi alors la loi lui a été appliquée. La loi, c’est la loi, la
loi ce n’est pas moi.
- La loi ne s’applique qu’au plus faible est une loi injuste.
Et le lion se jette sur le buffle, le terrasse, et libère le peuple des animaux.
C’est depuis ce jour qu’il est le roi des animaux. C’est aussi depuis ce jour qu’il s’efforce d’être
juste et droit.",French,Mali,amine

L’éléphant et le hérisson
Pays de collecte : Mali.
Un conte dit en français et en bambara par Ousmane Diarra.
Auteur : Ousmane Diarra.
Il était une fois les animaux de la brousse. Ils vivaient entre eux. Seuls sur la terre. Non, pas tout
à fait. Il y avait aussi dans la brousse les génies, les grands et les nains, qui, eux aussi, vivaient
entre eux. Quant aux hommes, ils n’avaient pas encore fait leur apparition sur la terre.
À cette époque-là, lointaine, très lointaine, il n’y avait sur toute surface de la terre qu’un seul
cours d’eau, une petite rivière aux eaux salées, qui appartenait au petit hérisson. Un génie nain,
un wokloni, avait eu la gentillesse de la lui montrer :
- C’est pour toi. Si quelqu’un y boit sans ta permission, la rivière disparaîtra. Si tu refuses à qui
que ce soit la permission d’y boire, la rivière disparaîtra pareillement.
De nature, le petit hérisson n’est pas méchant, malgré ses piquants qui lui en donnent l’air. Il
suffisait donc de lui demander : « Petit hérisson, je meurs de soif. Est-ce que je peux aller boire
dans ta rivière ? » Il répondait toujours par oui. Et tu pouvais te désaltérer à satiété.
Mais un jour, l’éléphant, piqué par on ne sait quelle mouche, se leva et déclara :
- Moi, le plus grand de tous les animaux, le plus puissant, le plus fort, que je sois obligé à chaque
fois de demander la permission à ce petit rien de hérisson, est inacceptable. Je ne le ferai donc
plus. Désormais, je boirai sans sa permission !
Le petit hérisson n’était pas présent. Mais les autres animaux, qui attendaient son arrivée, dirent
à l’éléphant :
- Ne fais pas ça, éléphant. Il ne te coûte rien de demander la permission au petit hérisson. Il n’a
jamais refusé de l’eau à personne.
Mais l’éléphant ne les écouta pas. Il se leva et alla boire l’eau de la rivière. Mais à peine eut-il
commencé à boire que la rivière se retira. Et l’éléphant partit en barrissant.
Quelques instants après, arriva le petit hérisson, qui trouva que sa petite rivière aux eaux salées
était à sec. Il se dressa sur ses petites pattes et demanda :
- Qui a bu toute l’eau de ma petite rivière ?
- C’est l’éléphant, répondirent en chœur les autres animaux. On le lui avait pourtant
déconseillé…
Et le petit hérisson de se dresser sur ses petites pattes et de chanter de sa voix courroucée :
« Ma petite rivière à moi
L’éléphant l’a vidée
Si jamais je vois l’éléphant
Si jamais jamais je rencontre l’éléphant
Je me battrais avec lui
Et je lui ferai rendre ma rivière
Parole de hérisson. »",French,Mali,amine

Ce disant, le petit hérisson partit à la recherche de l’éléphant, il trottinait tout seul dans la
brousse. De temps en temps, il se redressait sur ses petites pattes ou montait sur un arbre pour
chercher l’éléphant des yeux.
Il était vraiment en colère. Mais est-ce qu’un petit rien de hérisson peut vaincre le grand
éléphant ?
- Si ! Si ! Je le vaincrai, avait répondu le petit hérisson aux animaux qui l’avaient mis en garde.
Le petit hérisson marcha ainsi pendant longtemps. Ce fut vers le petit soir qu’il vit l’éléphant. Le
gros pachyderme avait fini d’engloutir des tonnes et des tonnes de nourriture et se reposait aux
rayons couchants du soleil. Il dormait.
Le petit hérisson se dirigea droit sur lui. Il lui donna un coup de patte, puis un autre et un autre
encore. L’éléphant se réveilla.
- C’est toi, toi qui a bu toute l’eau de ma petite rivière à moi, hein ? demanda le petit hérisson en
colère.
- Oui, c’est moi. C’est bien moi. Et que veux-tu ? bougonna l’éléphant.
- Me battre avec toi !
- Ah ! ah ! ah ! éclata de rie l’éléphant. Te battre avec moi ? Est-ce que tu n’es pas devenu fou ?
En réponse, le petit hérisson se mit à frapper l’éléphant. Et l’éléphant se fâcha. Il se leva. Il leva
sa trompe et frappa à son tour le petit hérisson. C’était ce qu’il ne fallait pas faire. Le petit
hérisson enfonça tous ses piquants dans la trompe de l’éléphant qui hurla de douleur et appela
tous les animaux au secours. Ceux-ci vinrent supplier le petit hérisson d’enlever ses piquants de
la trompe de l’éléphant.
Le petit hérisson, malgré ses piquants, n’est pas méchant. Il accepta volontiers de soigner
l'éléphant. C’est depuis ce jour que l’éléphant, malgré sa force, ne s’attaque jamais aux plus
petits que lui.",French,Mali,amine

L’histoire des trois amis
Pays de collecte : Mali.
Un conte dit en français et en bambara par Ambaga Guindo.
Auteur : Ousmane Diarra.
Il y a longtemps, très longtemps, oui c’était au commencement du monde, trois amis : le
vautour, le calao et la poule tombèrent malade. Le premier souffrait de calvitie, le second d’une
anomalie au bec, le troisième de crampes dans les pattes.
Pour se faire entendre, ils se mirent à chanter.
« Adaunia Nomba
Dauni Nomba yôyé
Dauni Nomba
Inden sanga nomba kôyé
La vie d’ici
Quelle vie ici !
La vie est aux enchères ! »
Dieu ne répondit pas, alors ils décidèrent d’aller directement voir Dieu pour qu’il les guérisse. La
poule contesta :
- Mes amis ne dépassons pas les bornes, Dieu ne va plus tarder. En agissant comme vous
envisagez de le faire, nous allons le mécontenter. Pourquoi nous presser ?
Le vautour et le calao n’écoutèrent pas la poule et partirent au ciel de leur vol lourd.
Tandis qu’ils montaient de plus en plus haut, Dieu arriva et guérit la poule. Depuis ce jour, le
vautour est resté chauve et le calao a un bec tordu. A présent ils continuent à planer dans les
airs à la recherche de Dieu.
Mais quand son copain le lui a demandé, elle a répondu :
- C’est le vieux caïman lui-même qui m’a aidée !
Le vieux caïman se tourna vers la tourterelle et lui dit :
-Ta chanson est certes belle. Mais je ne l’ai entendue que d’une oreille. Si tu venais te percher
sur ma langue pour la répéter, je l’entendrais des deux !
La petite tourterelle sauta sur la langue du vieux caïman et acheva sa chanson dans l’estomac de
celui-ci.
Ensuite, le vieux caïman vint se ranger auprès de Youma :
- Monte, ma fille. Je vais te faire traverser. Et gare à ton mari si de nouveau il touche un seul de
tes cheveux. Il aura affaire à moi !
Il fit traverser Youma et lui donna beaucoup de richesses : des vêtements, de l’or et des
chevaux. Elle devint une reine et fonda sa dynastie.",French,Mali,amine

L’hyène et les chèvres de la vieille femme
Pays de collecte : Mali.
Un conte dit en français et en bambara par Ousmane Diarra.
Auteur : Ousmane Diarra.
Il était une fois, dans un village, une vieille femme. Elle possédait beaucoup de chèvres. C’étaient de
grandes et grasses chèvres. Comme ses chèvres, en bêlant et en gambadant sur les toits des maisons,
embêtaient trop ses voisins du village, la vieille femme alla fonder un autre village où elle habitait
toute seule, au milieu de ses chèvres.
C’était l’occasion qu’espérait Surukuba l’hyène qui, depuis longtemps, brûlait de croquer les chèvres
de la vieille femme. Elle ne pouvait pas, parce que simplement elle en avait envie, aller comme ça, les
prendre et les manger. Le lion, le roi des animaux, lui demanderait de s’expliquer !
Alors, un jour, où Surukuba l’hyène se promenait dans la brousse, cherchant une idée, une raison de
manger les chèvres de la vieille femme sans qu’on ait à lui demander des comptes. Alors qu’elle se
grattait la tête, elle vit un oiseau. Elle sauta et le captura. « Tiens, se dit-elle. Je vais donner ce
volatile à la vieille femme. Si elle le mange, j’aurais un bon prétexte pour dévorer ses chèvres à belles
dents ! ». Elle courut chez la vieille femme et lui dit :
- Bonjour grand-mère. Comme tu es vieille et sans force, et qu’il est de notre devoir à nous les
jeunes, d’aider les personnes âgées, je t’offre cet oiseau. Mange-le, ça te fera du bien.
La vieille grand-mère prit l’oiseau, mais comme elle n’était pas bête, elle alla le cacher dans le toit de
sa case.
Dès le lendemain, voici l’hyène qui revient sur ses pas, toute joyeuse, pensant que, puisque la vieille
femme avait mangé son oiseau, elle pourrait à son tour dévorer ses chèvres :
- Bonjour vieille femme. Bonjour à mon oiseau !
- Ton oiseau ? lui demanda la vieille femme avec l’air faussement étonné, je croyais que tu me l’avais
donné !
- Ah non ! Ah non ! Mon oiseau, je te l’avais seulement confié. Et si tu l’as mangé, tu vas le payer
avec tes chèvres !
- Non, Surukuba. Je n’ai pas mangé ton oiseau. Il est là, dans le toit de ma case. Va le prendre !
- Comme les grands-mères ne comprennent rien de rien ! Je plaisantais avec toi quand j’ai dit que tu
allais le payer. Mange-le donc, cet oiseau. C’est pour toi. Foi d’hyène !
Pour autant, la vieille femme ne voulut pas manger l’oiseau. Chaque matin, l’hyène venait lui dire :
- Bonjour grand-mère ! Bonjour à mon oiseau.
Et quand la vieille femme lui disait de le reprendre, l’hyène refusait et s’en allait. Cela dura pendant
longtemps, très longtemps.
Jusqu’au jour où la vieille grand-mère étant partie dans la brousse chercher du bois mort, sa petite
fille venue du village voisin pendant son absence vit l’oiseau et le mangea. On ne sut jamais qui
rapporta la nouvelle à Surukuba l’hyène. Mais ce jour-là, Surukuba l’hyène n’attendit même pas le
lendemain. Dès l’après-midi, elle arriva toute joyeuse chez la vieille femme.
- Bonjour vieille femme. Bonjour à mon oiseau !
Toute tremblante, la vieille grand-mère lui dit :
- Ton oiseau, ma petite fille l’a mangé !
- Ah bon, Eh bien puisque ta petite fille a mangé mon oiseau, moi aussi, je vais prendre une de tes
chèvres que je vais manger avec ma famille !
L’hyène prit deux chèvres et les emporta.",French,Mali,amine

Le lendemain, elle revint chez la vieille femme :
- Bonjour vieille femme ! Bonjour à mon oiseau !
- Ton oiseau, je t’ai dit que ma fille l’a mangé !
- Eh bien, si ta fille l’a mangé, moi aussi, je vais manger trois de tes chèvres !
L’hyène emporta trois chèvres chez elle qu’elle mangea avec sa famille. Cela dura pendant
longtemps. A la fin, il ne restait plus qu’une seule chèvre dans l’enclos de la vieille grand-mère.
Entre temps, le lion qui passait par là, le lion vit la vieille grand-mère, qui pleurait. Il lui demanda :
- Grand-mère, qu’est-ce qui t’arrive donc ? La vieille femme lui expliqua que l’hyène lui avait donné
un oiseau que sa petite fille avait mangé.
- Et depuis, dit-elle, tous les jours, l’hyène vient enlever mes chèvres. Quand il n’y en aura plus, c’est
moi-même qu’elle va dévorer à belles dents !
Le lion alors lui dit de cacher dans sa case la chèvre qui restait et de l’attacher, lui, le lion, à sa place,
dans l’enclos.
- L’hyène viendra me trouver ici et on va voir ce qu’on va voir ! ajouta-t-il en souriant.
C’est ce que la vieille grand-mère fit.
Ce jour-là, Surukuba l’hyène n’attendit même pas le matin pour venir. Elle vint dès le crépuscule. Or,
au crépuscule, l’hyène voit mal.
- Bonjour vieille femme. Bonjour à mon oiseau !
- Ton oiseau, je te l’ai déjà dix mille fois, ton oiseau, ma petite fille l’a mangé !
- Eh bien ! si ta petite fille a mangé mon oiseau, moi aussi, je vais croquer tes chèvres.
- Il n’en reste plus qu’une seule. Va la prendre !
- C’est ce que je vais faire.
Et l’hyène alla détacher ce qu’elle croyait être une chèvre. La voici en train de la conduire chez elle.
Soudain, alors qu’elle marchait devant ce qu’elle pensait être une chèvre, elle se ravisa :
- Mon Dieu ! Je ne comprends rien. Les autres chèvres que j’ai amenées chez moi, en marchant
derrière moi faisaient craquer leurs articulations kumata kumata ! Celle-là, elle marche comme un
félin ! Est-ce vraiment une chèvre ?
Le lion fit craquer ses articulations. Rassurée, l’hyène continua son chemin.
Mais quelques instants après, elle s’arrêta de nouveau :
- Mon Dieu ! Mon Dieu ! Moi, je ne comprends rien du tout. Les autres chèvres que j’ai amenées chez
moi, que j’ai dévorées de belles dents, avec ma famille, ma femme et mes enfants, ont bêlé au moins
une fois, elles. Mais celle-là, elle n’a pas bêlé une seule fois ! Est-ce une chèvre, vraiment ?
Le lion essaya de bêler mais ce fut un grand rugissement qui lui échappa.
Et l’hyène se sauva à toutes pattes. Le lion ne la laissa pas s’en tirer à si bon compte. Il la poursuivit,
l’attrapa et lui assena un grand coup de patte sur son arrière-train. Il le fit et le refit plusieurs fois. Si

L’orphelin et les méchants villageois
Pays de collecte : Mali.
Un conte dit en français et en bambara par Ousmane Diarra.
Auteur : Ousmane Diarra.
Il était une fois, dans un village, un homme riche, très riche, qui possédait beaucoup de
troupeaux de vaches, de chèvres et de moutons. Il n’avait qu’un seul enfant, un garçon, encore
très jeune dont la mère était morte après lui avoir donné la vie !
Quand le vieil homme sentit venir sa propre mort, il s’inquiéta : qui allait conseiller son fils afin
qu’il ne se fasse pas dévorer par les vers mangeurs d’homme, les vers mangeurs d’hommes qui
migraient entre les deux grandes rivières où chaque jour, il allait abreuver ses troupeaux ? Les
villageois n’allaient pas le faire. Au contraire, ceux-ci jubilaient déjà à l’idée de le voir mourir et
son jeune fils le suivre dès le lendemain, dévoré par les vers mangeurs d’hommes. Ils allaient se
partager ses troupeaux !
Il alla confier son garçon à un arbre, un vieux caïlcédrat :
- Je vais mourir, dit-il. Je te confie mon fils afin que tu le conseilles.
Puis il mourut.
Le matin, avant d’amener ses troupeaux au pâturage, le jeune garçon vint chanter à l’arbre :
- Mon père m’a confié à toi, grand caïlcédrat. Dois-je conduire mes animaux à Toubalitou ? Ou
dois-je les amener à Diabalidia ?
L’arbre secoua trois fois ses lourdes branches chargées de feuilles et laissa entendre :
- Va à Toubalitou. Ne va pas à Diabalidia. Les vers mangeurs d’homme seront aujourd’hui à
Diabalidia !
Il amena ses animaux à Toubalitou et vers le soir, retourna sain et sauf au village.
Les villageois étaient étonnés et furieux. Quelqu’un devait conseiller le garçon pour qu’il ne se fît
pas manger par les vers ! Ils allaient trouver qui. Ce fut un chasseur qui s’en chargea et leur
rapporta le secret. Ils abattirent l’arbre, le brûlèrent et jetèrent la cendre dans le fleuve.
Quand l’orphelin vint pour lui demander conseil, il ne vit rien. Il pleura et chanta quand même sa
chanson. On ne savait rien. Ce fut une tourterelle qui lui répondit. Et de nouveau, il rentra au
village saint et sauf. On s’étonna de nouveau. On était furieux contre le chasseur. Il leur avait
menti.
Le chasseur leur révéla de nouveau le secret et leur promit de tuer la tourterelle. Il ne le put
jamais. Il devint fou et court de nos jours encore en tirant des coups de feu contre le ciel qu’il
prend pour sa tourterelle.
C’est aussi depuis ce jour que les hommes et les femmes sages disent à leurs enfants de ne
jamais tuer une tourterelle.",French,Mali,amine

La chèvre et le vieillard
Pays de collecte : Mali.
Un conte dit en français et en bambara par Ousmane Diarra.
Auteur : Ousmane Diarra.
Il y a très longtemps, dans une contrée lointaine où les forêts étaient partout, vivait seul un
hideux vieillard avec une chèvre qu’il aimait par-dessus tout. Celle-ci était très vieille mais restait
en vie par amour pour lui. Le vieillard désirait une descendance.
Un beau jour, alors que le vieillard était allé couper du bois, sa chèvre voulant lui prouver son
amour alla voir le génie de l’arbre.
Arrivée là-bas, le génie lui demanda de sa voix grave :
- Que veux-tu petit animal ?
- Je voudrais rendre mon maître heureux.
- De quelle manière puis-je t’aider ?
- Mon maître souhaite une descendance et j’aimerais la lui apporter.
Le génie réfléchit un moment puis lui dit :
- Je peux te transformer en femme. Tout heureuse la chèvre sautait déjà partout à l’idée de
rendre le vieillard heureux.
C’est à ce moment-là que le génie énonça une phrase bizarre :
- Kalakou, Kalakou, bérékoukiiiiiiii
Et la chèvre se transforma en une superbe femme.
- Je te remercie grand génie de l’arbre.
Alors qu’elle s’en retournait, le génie lui cria :
- Tu sacrifieras ton cinquième enfant sur mon arbre.
Elle rentra chez elle sans prêter attention à ce que lui disait le génie. Quand le vieillard rentra
chez lui, il fut surpris de trouver une femme. La jeune femme rassura le vieillard :
- C’est moi ta chèvre ! Je suis allée voir le génie de l’arbre pour qu’il me transforme en femme
afin d’assurer ta descendance comme tu le souhaitais.
Il la reconnut. Ils eurent un premier enfant puis un deuxième, un troisième, un quatrième, et le
cinquième. La vie se déroula, ils vécurent heureux, sans problème. Un jour, alors que les enfants
jouaient dans la forêt, le cinquième enfant alla se cacher derrière un arbre. L’arbre l’attrapa et
se mit à l’engloutir. Il se mit à chanter en s’adressant à ses frères :
« Bori, bori, djinamori, bori
Bori djinamori

Les autres enfants, ayant entendu les cris de leur frère, allèrent prévenir leur mère.
- Maman, Maman…
La mère entendit leurs cris et leur demanda :
- Mais que se passe-t-il mes petits ?
- Bourouki s’est fait engloutir par l’arbre et il chante
« Bori, bori, djinamori, bori
Bori djinamori
Ka ta fo m’bayé
Djinamori bori
Bori djinamori »
La femme se souvint alors de ce que lui avait dit le génie. Elle alla voir celui-ci avec son mari, le
vieil homme.
- Rends-moi mon enfant, dit-elle au génie.
Le génie lui répondit :
- Tu sacrifieras ton cinquième enfant sur mon arbre, souviens-toi. Tu l’as fait, alors je le prends !
La femme lui répondit :
- Mais tu n’as pas précisé à quel âge je devais le sacrifier et ceci est une faute dans les droits
conférés aux génies. Tu dois donc me le rendre.
Le génie réfléchit et avoua :
- C’est vrai, malheureuse, tu as raison, je dois te le rendre. Ils repartirent donc avec les cinq
enfants et vécurent heureux.

La jeune femme, la tourterelle et le vieux
caïman
Pays de collecte : Mali.
Un conte dit en français et en bambara par Kari Coulibaly.
Auteur : Ousmane Diarra.
Youma était une orpheline. Sa mère était morte en lui donnant la vie. Très jeune, on l’avait
marié à un homme. Un homme jaloux, si jaloux qu’il avait quitté tout le monde pour aller
s’installer au milieu de la forêt. Tous les soirs, de retour de la chasse, il battait Youma.
Ce soir-là, il fut particulièrement cruel. Après avoir battu Youma comme on bat son mil, il
s’empara de son fusil et menaça de la tuer. Youma se sauva dans la nuit. Elle voulait rejoindre le
village de ses parents. Mais le village de ses parents et le hameau de son mari étaient séparés
par une grande rivière. Dans cette rivière vivait un vieux caïman mangeur d’homme. Une fois la
nuit tombée, personne ne pouvait traverser cette rivière sans se faire dévorer par le vieux
caïman.
Youma se retrouva au bord de la rivière. Si elle s’y jetait, le vieux caïman allait la dévorer. Si elle
retournait chez son mari, celui-ci allait peut-être la tuer. Elle tremblait, pleurait, se lamentait.
Soudain, la rivière se mit à remuer dans tous les sens, balayée comme par une tempête. Et dans
l’obscurité, Youma vit émerger de l’eau et nager vers elle quelque chose comme une île
flottante. C’était le vieux caïman. Il vint s’amarrer prêt de Youma et lui dit :
- Monte sur mon dos, ma fille. Je vais te faire traverser !
Youma monta et le caïman la transporta sur l’autre rive. En la déposant, il lui dit cependant :
- Que cela reste entre nous ! Personne d’autre ne doit le savoir !
Youma rentra chez ses parents. Sa marâtre effrayée lui demanda :
- Qui t’a aidé à traverser la rivière ? Dis-moi !
Elle répondit en baissant les yeux :
- Personne.
Son père lui posa la même question. Les vieux du village, les jeunes, à tous elle répondit :
- Personne.
Mais le jour où son copain d’enfance lui dit :
- Entre nous, qui t’a fait traverser la rivière ? Il y a le vieux caïman mangeur d’homme. Même les
plus braves chasseurs ne peuvent s’y hasarder une fois la nuit venue ! Dis-moi le secret, entre
nous !
Elle répondit :
- C’est le vieux caïman lui-même qui m’a aidé ! Mais que cela reste entre nous !
Mais cela ne resta pas entre eux. Car ce que Youma ne savait pas, c’était que la petite
tourterelle la surveillait. La petite tourterelle qui avait été témoin du pacte avec le vieux caïman!
Arriva le jour où elle devait retourner chez son mari. De nouveau, toute seule, elle se retrouva
au bord de la rivière, dans la nuit. C’était le clair de lune. Le vieux caïman émergea de l’eau et
commença à nager vers elle quand la petite tourterelle, perchée sur une branche, chanta :
- Son père le lui a demandé, elle a répondu : Personne !
Sa mère le lui a demandé : Personne !
Même les vieux le lui ont demandé, toujours : Personne !",French,Mali,amine

Mais quand son copain le lui a demandé, elle a répondu :
- C’est le vieux caïman lui-même qui m’a aidée !
Le vieux caïman se tourna vers la tourterelle et lui dit :
-Ta chanson est certes belle. Mais je ne l’ai entendue que d’une oreille. Si tu venais te percher
sur ma langue pour la répéter, je l’entendrais des deux !
La petite tourterelle sauta sur la langue du vieux caïman et acheva sa chanson dans l’estomac de
celui-ci.
Ensuite, le vieux caïman vint se ranger auprès de Youma :
- Monte, ma fille. Je vais te faire traverser. Et gare à ton mari si de nouveau il touche un seul de
tes cheveux. Il aura affaire à moi !
Il fit traverser Youma et lui donna beaucoup de richesses : des vêtements, de l’or et des
chevaux. Elle devint une reine et fonda sa dynastie.",French,Mali,amine

La méchante coépouse
Pays de collecte : Mali.
Un conte dit en français et en bambara par Ousmane Diarra.
Auteur : Ousmane Diarra.
Il était une fois un roi qui avait une première femme, et vint à en épouser une seconde.
Lorsqu’arriva cette deuxième femme, la première ne put le supporter, et s’en alla trouver les
marabouts. Ceux-ci par leurs maléfices, finirent par transformer la jeune femme en hyène, et
celle-ci partit dans la brousse.
La marâtre dit à l’aîné des enfants que sa mère était devenue folle. Cependant, à la nuit tombée,
la mère venait derrière les maisons, et parlait avec sa fille :
- Arabadièkè, ma fille, dors-tu ?
- Non, non je ne dors pas !
- Il y a des arachides dans le grenier en as-tu donné à ton frère ?
- Il y a de la crème dans la petite gourde en as-tu donné à ton frère ?
- Ma méchante co-épouse m’a transformée en hyène. Oh la la !
Puis elle retournait dans la brousse. Cela dura longtemps, longtemps.
Cependant une petite vieille finit par s’apercevoir du manège, et s’en alla trouver le roi :
- Roi, lui dit-elle, on dit que la mère de tes enfants est devenue folle ; mais elle n’est pas
devenue folle du tout, c’est sa co-épouse qui a lancé contre elle des maléfices et la transformée
en hyène.
- Quoi ?
- Parfaitement !
Alors le roi chargea son fusil et monta sur le toit d’une grande maison, et attendit. À la nuit
tombée, l’hyène arriva :
- Arabadièkè, ma fille, dors-tu ?
- Non, non je ne dors pas !
- Il y a des arachides dans le grenier, en as-tu donné à ton frère ?
- Il y a de la crème dans la petite gourde en as-tu donné à ton frère ?
- Ma méchante co-épouse m’a transformée en hyène. Oh la la !
Quand elle voulut s’en aller, le roi sauta du toit de la maison et l’attrapa. Il s’en alla la montrer à
sa femme.
- N’est-ce pas toi, lui dit-il, qui est responsable de cela? N’est-ce pas le résultat de tes maléfices ?
Alors, il déchargea sur elle son fusil et la tua. Et au moment même où il tuait la marâtre, l’hyène
perdit sa forme animale et redevint la jeune femme qu’elle était auparavant.

La princesse orgueilleuse
Pays de collecte : Mali.
Un conte dit en français et en bambara par Kari Coulibaly.
Auteur : Ousmane Diarra (recueilli par Eric Chevillard).
Un roi voulait marier sa fille, mais celle-ci ne trouvait aucun prétendant à son goût. Les hommes
les plus beaux, les plus riches, les plus nobles, les plus valeureux faisaient en vain leur cour. En
vain, ils déposaient fleurs et cadeaux à ses pieds, qu’elle avait menus et fins, reconnaissons-le, et
c’était soudain en les regardant comme si le reste du monde n’était peuplé que de palmipèdes.
Elle contemplait dans les yeux des hommes sa beauté hautaine et implacable. Une telle
perfection n’est pas de ce monde, pensait-elle. Qui sont-ils tous pour se prétendre dignes de
moi ?
Par orgueil, elle se mura dans le silence et ne prononça bientôt plus un mot. Était-elle devenue
muette ? Le roi au désespoir promit d’accorder sa main à celui qui saurait dissiper ce funeste
sortilège et lui rendre la parole. Mais les multiples tentatives de ses courtisans échouèrent les
unes après les autres. Ni les sacrifices ni les prières ne lui firent desserrer les lèvres.
Un jour, un lépreux se présenta devant la princesse. Il était vêtu de haillons comme si son habit
aussi avait contracté le mal hideux qui le dépouillait. Tout le monde alentour se mit à rire et se
moquer.
- Comment ! Les hommes les plus beaux du pays, les plus riches, les plus nobles, les plus
valeureux n’ont su réjouir son cœur et lui rendre la parole, et toi, chien galeux, lépreux
immonde, « guenillard », tu prétends y parvenir !
La fille du roi elle-même sembla se rembrunir davantage, mais le lépreux ne dit rien. Il accorda à
peine un regard à la princesse. Il s’assit sur ses talons et commença à dresser un petit feu pour
faire bouillir l’eau de son thé. Il ne mit que deux pierres dans le foyer si bien que la théière mal
assurée se renversa sur le sable. Il l’emplit d’eau à nouveau, à nouveau il la posa sur les deux
pierres, à nouveau elle se renversa. Patiemment, il recommença, deux fois, trois fois encore et
deux fois, trois fois encore la théière se renversa.
À la cinquième tentative, la princesse excédée s’écria :
- Mets donc une troisième pierre dans ton feu pour assurer l’équilibre !
Et c’est ainsi qu’une très orgueilleuse princesse épousa un lépreux.",French,Mali,amine

Le lion et le hérisson
Pays de collecte : Mali.
Un conte dit en français et en bambara par Ousmane Diarra.
Auteur : Ousmane Diarra.
Cette année-là, au pays des animaux, il ne tomba pas une seule goutte de pluie. Et pour ne rien
arranger, les criquets étaient venus dévorer le peu de végétation qui avait poussé. Le lion, leur
roi, les convoqua dans son palais et leur tint ce discours :
« Chers sujets, comme vous le savez tous, il n’est pas tombé une seule goutte de pluie dans
notre pays. Il n’y a pas de nourriture. Aussi, moi, votre roi, le roi de tous les animaux, je décrète :
Article 1 : Que personne ne vienne me demander à manger. Car je n’ai rien.
Article 2 : Que chacun se débrouille comme il peut.
Article 3 : Dispersez-vous ! »
Les animaux se dispersèrent, chacun allant de son côté. Mais avant, le cheval dit :
« Moi, je vais rejoindre les hommes au village. Ces petits êtres à deux pattes sont intelligents et
ingénieux. En échange de mes services, ils me donneront à boire et à manger ».
Il gagna le village en galopant. Il devint ainsi un animal domestique. L’âne, le mouton, le
dromadaire, bref, tous les animaux aujourd’hui domestiques dirent la même chose et
rejoignirent les hommes au village.
Mais l’hyène, après mure réflexion, trouva que c’était vrai que ces petits êtres bizarres qui
marchaient à deux pattes étaient intelligents et inventifs, mais qu’ils possédaient un bâton, long,
très long, qui crachait du feu ! Elle, l’hyène, par prudence, allait attendre un peu et se
débrouiller dans la brousse ! Le lion lui donna raison. La girafe et l’éléphant lui donnèrent raison.
Même le petit hérisson trouva que l’hyène avait totalement raison. Parce que prudence est
mère de sûreté ! Tous les animaux aujourd’hui encore sauvages donnèrent raison à l’hyène et
préférèrent mourir de faim que de rôtir au fond d’une casserole ! Ils s’enfoncèrent davantage
dans la forêt.
Le petit hérisson, qui errait seul dans la brousse vit un arbre à samba, couvert de fruit murs et
délicieux. Il monta sur l’arbre et commença à manger. Vint le lion qui le vit sur l’arbre. Le lion lui
demanda de lui envoyer quelques fruits. C’était vrai que lui, le roi de tous les animaux, il avait
imposé à chacun de se débrouiller tout seul. Mais cela faisait trois jours qu’il n’avait rien mis
sous la dent. Le hérisson lui envoya un premier fruit. Il le mangea. Hum ! C’était délicieux. Il
envoya un deuxième fruit. Le lion le mangea. Mais le troisième fruit vint frapper le lion sur son
museau royal !
« A moi ça ? A moi, petit hérisson, rugit le lion. Malheur à toi ! Grand grand malheur à toi si tu
descends ! »
Le petit hérisson resta dans l’arbre. Il pleurait. Il se lamentait. Quelques temps après, arriva
l’hyène. Elle vit le petit hérisson en train de pleurer abondamment. Elle eut pitié et dit :
« Petit hérisson, que t’est-il arrivé ? Ton arbre est plein de fruits. Il faut manger au lieu de
pleurer ! »
En réponse le petit hérisson chanta :
« Tout à l’heure, le lion a dit que chacun devait se débrouiller comme il pouvait. Mais voici ce
même lion qui vient me demander des fruits. Le fruit est tombé sur le museau, et il m’a dit :
Malheur à toi. Grand grand malheur à toi petit hérisson ! »",French,Mali,amine

L’hyène n’avait pas vu le lion. Quand elle le vit et que le lion la menaça de son regard furibond,
elle s’enfuit en disant : « Eh bien, malheur à toi ! Grand grand malheur à toi petit hérisson ! »
La grande girafe au long cou, la girafe elle aussi passait par là. Quand elle vit le petit hérisson en
train de pleurer dans les branches de l’arbre à samba, elle eut pitié et lui en demanda la raison.
Mais quand la raison lui fut expliquée et qu’elle eut vu le lion au pied de l’arbre, elle s’enfuit en
criant « Eh bien, malheur à toi ! Grand grand malheur à toi petit hérisson ! »
Le buffle arriva et dit la même chose. Même le grand éléphant dit la même chose. Tout le
monde dit la même chose. Tout le monde ? Non.
Le petit lièvre arriva sur son cheval, en fait, un grand coq qui galopait en chantant :
« La vérité, rien que la vérité et toujours la vérité ! »
Le petit lièvre vit le petit hérisson au sommet de l’arbre, qui pleurait, pleurait sans s’arrêter. Il lui
demanda :
« Que t’arrive-t-il, petit hérisson ? »
Le petit hérisson lui chanta sa petite chanson :
« Tout à l’heure, le lion a dit que chacun devait se débrouiller comme il pouvait. Mais voici ce
même lion qui vient me demander des fruits. Le fruit lui est tombé sur le museau, et il m’a dit :
Malheur à toi ! Grand grand malheur à toi petit hérisson ! »
Le petit lièvre n’avait pas vu le lion au pied de l’arbre. Quand il le vit et que le lion le menaça de
son regard, il lui cria :
« Va-t-en d’ici ! C’est toi même qui a dit que chacun devait se débrouiller comme il pouvait. Tu
n’as pas le droit de venir menacer le petit hérisson ».
Le lion bondit pour attraper le petit lièvre. Mais celui-ci se sauva sur son cheval de coq vers le
village. Le lion le poursuivit. Mais à l’entrée du village, il y avait, debout derrière un arbre, un
homme qui tenait un long bâton. Quand le lion vit cet homme, il retourna dans la brousse. Le
petit lièvre entra dans le village et devint le lapin.",French,Mali,amine

Le repère du génie à tête de bouc
Pays de collecte : Mali.
Un conte dit en français et en bambara par Ousmane Diarra.
Auteur : Ousmane Diarra.
Un couple eut trois garçons. Au premier, il donna le prénom Fakamè, celui qui obéit au père,
parce que celui-ci, toujours faisait ce que son père lui demandait de faire. Le deuxième s’appela
Bakamè, celui qui obéit à la mère. Lui, il ne refusait jamais ce que sa mère lui demandait de
faire.Comme le troisième n’obéissait à personne et faisait les choses à sa tête, le couple le
nomma Yérékamè, celui qui n’en fait qu’à sa tête.
Un jour, les trois garçons et leurs parents étaient en train de cultiver leur champ quand la pluie
se mit soudain à tomber drue. Ils allèrent s’abriter dans une grotte. Quelques instants après,
arriva un être bizarre, cornu, qui avait cent têtes, cent yeux, cent oreilles… Et puait à cent lieux à
la ronde. C’était Bilissi ! Bilissi le génie à tête de bouc ! Le père le savait. Il vint se coucher au
travers de l’entrée de la grotte, enfermant les deux parents et leurs trois garçons à l’intérieur !
Comment allaient-ils faire pour se tirer de cette trappe ?
Le père réfléchit un moment puis dit à Fakamè, celui qui obéit au père :
- Fakamè, on voit que cette pluie ne va pas s’arrêter. Tes parents commencent à attraper le
froid. Peux-tu aller nous chercher du feu, s’il te plaît ?
Fakamè obéit. Et Bilissi s’écarta pour le laisser sortir.
Il ne revint pas.
Quelque temps, le père se tourna vers Bakamè, celui qui obéit à la mère et lui dit :
- Bakamè, j’ai envoyé Fakamè chercher le feu. Il n’est pas revenu. Pourrais-tu, toi, aller chercher
le feu pour tes vieux parents qui commencent à attraper le froid ?
Bakamè obéit. Le génie à tête de bouc le laissa sortir.
Il ne revint pas.
Le père se tourna alors vers Yérékamè et le pria d’aller chercher le feu pour ses vieux parents.
- Moi, dit Yérékamè, sous cette pluie battante ? Jamais de la vie ! Crevez si vous voulez, je ne
sortirai pas !
Le père se tourna alors vers sa femme et lui dit :
- Comme Yérékamè a refusé d’aller nous chercher le feu, pourrais-tu aller, toi ? Tu es plus jeune
que moi pour supporter la pluie et le vent ». La mère obéit. Bilissi s’écarta et la laisser sortir.
Elle ne revint pas.
Comme la mère ne revenait pas, le père dit à Yérékamè :
- Comme tu ne peux sortir sous la pluie, c’est donc moi qui vais te chercher le feu. Je reviens un
instant !
Bilissi s’écarta et le laissa sortir. Mais à peine le père eut-il disparu que le génie à tête de bouc,
qui avait cent yeux, cent mains et cents pieds se dirigea droit sur Yérékamè :
- Je savais que ton père rusait. Il voulait sauver sa famille. Je l’ai laissé faire en connaissance de
cause. Mais comme toi tu n’en fais qu’à ta tête…

Les funérailles du grand calao
Pays de collecte : Mali.
Un conte dit en français et en bambara par Ousmane Diarra.
Auteur : Ousmane Diarra.
Le calao est un grand oiseau noir, avec un grand sac rouge sous le cou. C’est dans ce grand sac
qu’il mettait les crapauds et les grenouilles qu’il allait chaque jour capturer dans la brousse. Il
revenait les partager avec sa famille.
Comme il ne plaît à personne de garnir le plat d’un autre tous les jours, les grenouilles et les
crapauds décidèrent se mettre à l’abri, comme ils n’avaient pas de moyens pour se défendre (ils
n’ont ni bec ni serres !). Ils allèrent donc se réfugier au fond de la rivière, où ils bâtirent leurs
maisons. Le calao qui ne sait ni nager ni pêcher ne trouva donc plus à manger.
Chaque matin, il partait à la chasse, battait toute la brousse en vain. Le soir, il rentrait bredouille
à la maison, et écoutait avec peine les cris et les pleurs de sa femme et de ses enfants :
- On va mourir de faim !
À la fin le calao, était tellement affamé qu’il ne pouvait même plus aller à la chasse. Chaque
matin, il se traînait jusqu’à la porte de sa case où il restait couché, pleurant et gémissant comme
une orpheline :
- Je vais mourir ! Toute ma famille va mourir de faim !
Un jour Zozani le lièvre qui passait par là le vit dans cet état.
- Qu’est-ce qui t’arrive donc, frère calao, demanda ce dernier apitoyé ? Quand le calao lui eut
expliqué ce qui lui arrivait, Zozani le lièvre lui dit :
- Voilà ce que tu vas faire. Demain, matin de bonne heure, tu vas recouvrir ton corps de
soumbala et te coucher au bord de la rivière pour faire le mort. On va voir ce qu’on va voir !
Le lendemain, le calao fit comme Zozani le lièvre le lui avait demandé. Par sa femme, il se fit
oindre le corps avec du soumbala et du datu, des condiments qui sentent très fort. Puis il alla se
coucher au bord de la rivière. Zozani le lièvre vint l’ausculter avant de descendre au fond de la
rivière annoncer au roi des crapauds et des grenouilles que le calao était mort. Ce dernier ne le
prit pas au mot. Il le fît accompagner par le prince héritier pour aller constater le décès du calao.
Le prince héritier du pays des crapauds et des grenouilles vit le calao étendu au bord de la
rivière. Il avait les ailes déployées et des légions de mouches bourdonnaient tout autour. Le
prince héritier des grenouilles et des crapauds ne crut pas pour autant à la mort du calao. Il lui
donna un puis deux coups de pieds. Le calao ne bougea pas. Il alla prendre une épine et piqua et
piqua encore le calao. Celui-ci ne bougea pas.
Quand il eut tout fait sans que le calao ne bougea, il redescendit alors au fond de la rivière en
courant :
- Papa ! Papa ! Oncle calao est mort et bien mort ! Il est même en train de pourrir. Si on
n’organise pas ses funérailles tout de suite, il ne restera rien de lui ! » Aussitôt, le roi appela tout
le monde à sortir de l’eau pour aller célébrer la mort du calao. Et tous, femmes, hommes,
enfants sortirent avec des tam-tams et des balafons. Ils firent un grand cercle autour du calao et
commencèrent à chanter et danser :
- Oncle calao est mort, vive les grenouilles et les crapauds !
- Grand frère calao est mort, vive nous !",French,Mali,amine

Le calao les laissa chanter et danser jusqu’à ce qu’ils soient tombés ivres morts. Ce fut alors que
le calao sauta sur ses pattes et commença à les ramasser : « J’en avale pour ma propre faim et
j’en mets dans mon sac pour ma famille ! » Ceux des grenouilles et des crapauds qui ont
échappés à sa rage se sont réfugiés de nouveau au fond de la rivière, et depuis, n’en sortent
plus. Même pour chanter, ceux qui ne peuvent naturellement s’empêcher de le faire, se
contentent de sortir le bout de leur nez pour lancer leur chant et redescendre aussitôt.",French,Mali,amine

Les huit petites gamines et l’hyène
Pays de collecte : Mali.
Un conte dit en français par Ousmane Diarra.
Auteur : Ousmane Diarra.
Huit petites gamines aimaient se promener dans les bois environnants. Un jour, alors qu’elles
cueillaient des fleurs, la pluie commença à tomber. Elles cherchèrent un abri et virent une
grotte. Elles y entrèrent. C’était la maison de Surukuba l’hyène.
Quelques instants après, l’hyène arriva en galopant. Dès qu’elle fut aux abords de la grotte, elle
s’arrêta en s’exclamant :
- Hum ! Ça sent la petite gamine ici !
Puis elle s’approcha de la grotte et regardant à l’intérieur, elle s’écria :
- Vous êtes combien, les petites gamines ?
Les huit fillettes lui répondirent d’une seule voix en chantant :
- Huit petites gamines !
Nous sommes bien huit petites gamines,
Pour remplir la gueule de l’hyène !
Transportée de joie, l’hyène sauta, bondit et s’en alla en galopant. Elle voulait raconter ça à une
autre hyène. Si elle les mangeait tout de suite, et si elle racontait ensuite qu’elle avait un jour
trouvé huit petites gamines bien menues dans sa maison à elle personne ne la croirait ! Il fallait
donc qu’elle trouve un témoin.
Elle partit au galop, répétant la chanson des huit petites gamines :
- Huit petites gamines,
Pour remplir l’hyène.
Elle trouva un compère et l’invita à aller voir ce qu’elle avait trouvé dans sa grotte. Dans sa
maison à elle : huit petites gamines bien potelées ! Mais avant leur arrivée, deux fillettes étaient
sorties de la grotte pour gagner le village.
Les six leur répondirent :
- Oui, nous sommes bien huit petites gamines pour amuser les crocs des huit hyènes !
Les deux hyènes s’en retournèrent au galop. Elles devaient trouver une troisième ? Pourquoi pas
une quatrième ? Puis une cinquième ? Puis… Car, elles étaient bien huit, les gamines.
Mais quand les hyènes revinrent et demandèrent :
- Vous êtes combien, les gamines ?
C’est une seule voix qui leur répondit. Et quand elles se ruèrent dans la grotte, elles n’y
trouvèrent qu’une petite bague que l’aînée des fillettes y avait déposée. C’était cette petite
bague qui leur avait répondu.
Furieuse, elles se ruèrent aux trousses des fillettes. Elles arrivèrent au village, quand l’aînée des
fillettes escaladait la clôture. Une hyène l’attrapa son pied :
- Je te tiens, petite maligne. Et je vais te manger !
L’aînée des fillettes éclata de rire :
- Oh ! gros bêta ! Ce n’est pas mon pied que tu tiens là, mais un bois de la clôture.
L’hyène laissa le pied de la fille et attrapa le bois. La fillette sauta dans le village et alerta les
chasseurs.",French,Mali,amine

Les mauvais amis
Pays de collecte : Mali.
Un conte dit en français et en bambara par Ambaga Guindo.
Le crocodile et le chien sont de bons amis. Ils se fréquentent et s’entraident.
Un jour de fête, le chien invite le crocodile à partager un bon repas de haricots.
- Des haricots ! J’accepte volontiers de les partager avec toi, dit le crocodile.
Chienne, l’épouse du chien, présente donc à l’hôte un plat bien garni. Mais, avant de manger, le
chien lui dit :
- Il est une coutume chez moi : pour manger il faut que l’invité soit assis.
Mais le crocodile n’arrive pas à s’asseoir. Il essaie, mais hélas, épuisé et humilié, il rentre chez
lui, abandonnant le chien et la chienne qui, très contents, mangent les haricots à sa place.
Le crocodile, à son tour, prépare un bon couscous lors de son anniversaire et invite son ami le
chien. Ce dernier arrive tôt avec sa femme. L’odeur de la sauce se répand et emplit la
maisonnée.
- Ça sent vraiment bon, dit le chien.
- Oui, bientôt nous nous mettrons à table, mais commencez déjà à sécher vos museaux car ce
repas d’anniversaire, pour le manger, il faut être propre.
Malheureusement, le chien a toujours le nez mouillé. Chien et chienne sortent au soleil pour
exposer leurs museaux. Mais rien ne change. Le soir, ils ont toujours le nez mouillé. Alors le
crocodile mange seul son délicieux plat.
Furieux, le chien quitte son ami en jurant :
- Gare à toi, si je te trouve hors de l’eau !
Le crocodile répond au chien :
- Gare à toi aussi si je te trouve autour de mes mares !

Mariko, le chasseur têtu et l’iguane d’eau
Pays de collecte : Mali.
Un conte dit en français et en bambara par Ousmane Diarra.
Auteur : Ousmane Diarra.
Mariko était un chasseur ! Mais quel chasseur ! Il tuait les animaux comme si ce n’étaient pas
des vies. Chaque jour, il en tuait des dizaines et des dizaines dont il exhibait les têtes et les
queues comme trophées.
Un jour, sa femme qui n’en pouvait plus de le voir ainsi massacrer les animaux, le conseilla en
ces termes :
- Mariko, s’il te plait, arrête de tuer les animaux comme tu le fais. Ce n’est pas bien. Ce sont des
vies.
Mariko se moqua de sa femme. Et dès le lendemain, il alla massacrer trois dizaines de bêtes
sauvages dont il ramena les queues au village.
À leur tour, les anciens du village le convoquèrent dans leur vestibule et lui dirent :
- Mariko, arrête de tuer les animaux comme tu le fais. Si les chasseurs qui t’ont précédé sur
cette terre avaient fait comme toi, tu ne serais pas devenu chasseur car, pas un seul animal
sauvage ne leur aurait survécu.
Mariko se moqua des anciens. Et dès le lendemain, il alla massacrer quatre dizaines de bêtes
dont il ramena les queues au village.
Ce jour-là, Mariko partit à la chasse. Toute la journée, il battit en vain la savane et ne rencontra
aucune bête. Même pas un petit écureuil.
Le soir venu, il s’en retournait bredouille au village en maugréant quand il vit, allongé au bord de
la rivière, un grand lézard qui se prélassait aux derniers rayons du soleil couchant. Ses yeux
brillèrent de joie. Il n’allait pas essuyer les moqueries de villageois en rentrant bredouille. Il
pointa son arme sur le lézard et allait tirer quand celui-ci, se mettant debout comme un homme,
il chanta :
« Ne me tue pas Mariko. Ne me tue pas.
Je ne suis pas un lézard ordinaire.
Vois-tu ?
Les marchands du Nord, du Sud
De l’Est et de l’Ouest passent et repassent
Par ce chemin.
Ils me voient ici, tous les jours.
Ils ne m’ont pas tué parce qu’eux, ils savent
Que je ne suis pas un lézard comme les autres ! »
Mariko lui répondit en éclatant de rire :
- Vieux lézard, même si tu chantes toutes les chansons de ton répertoire, moi, je vais te tuer ! Et
pan ! il tua le lézard. Il le prit et le jeta sur son épaule et rentra au village.
Au moment de franchir la porte de sa maison, le lézard, bien que mort, lui chanta de nouveau :
- Ne me tue pas, Mariko. Je ne suis pas un lézard ordinaire…
Mariko lui répondit :
- Continue de chanter, hein ! Je vais te rôtir et te manger tout à l’heure. Et on verra bien si tu
peux continuer de chanter dans mon ventre !",French,Mali,amine

Il alla jeter le lézard devant sa femme :
- Prépare-moi ça, ma chérie. Je meurs de faim.
- Moi ? lui rétorqua sa femme. Non seulement, je ne prépare pas ce lézard. Mais je ne le
mangerai pas. Mes enfants ne le mangeront pas non plus. Tu m’entends, Mariko ?
- Tant pis. Je me le préparerai moi-même.
Et Mariko de dépecer le lézard. Il le découpa en morceaux et jeta les morceaux dans le poêle.
Mais même en mijotant sur le feu, chaque morceau du lézard chantait :
- Ne me tue pas Mariko. Je ne suis pas un lézard comme les autres.
- Tu vas être prêt et je vais te dévorer à belles dents, dit Mariko. Et on verra bien si tu vas
continuer de chanter !
Quand le lézard fut bien cuit, Mariko, se mit à le manger. Il invita sa femme. Sa femme refusa. Il
invita ses enfants, tous refusèrent. Et il mangea tout seul.
Aussitôt qu’il eut fini de manger, il eut soif, une grande soif qui se mit à lui brûler la gorge. Il cria
sur sa femme :
- Apporte-moi à boire ! Je meurs de soif, je meurs de soif !
Sa femme lui apporta verre d’eau qu’il but d’une rasade. La soif s’aggrava.
Il cria sur ses enfants :
- Apportez-moi de l’eau ! Je meurs de soif ! Je meurs de soif !
Chaque enfant lui apporta une cruche d’eau. Il les avala d’une traite. La soif s’aggrava. Mariko se
leva et alla prendre le canari d’eau. Il avala la contenance d’une seule rasade. La soif empira.
Il sortit de la maison en courant, sortit du village à toute allure. Il partit à la rivière, celle au bord
de laquelle il avait tué le lézard. Il se baissa et commença à boire l’eau de la rivière. Mais la soif
s’aggrava. Il but, but et but. Son ventre s’enfla, se gonfla et finit par exploser. Les morceaux du
lézard en sortirent, se recollèrent. Et soudain, le lézard se dressa devant Mariko mourant et lui
dit :
- Que t’avais-je dis, Mariko ? Tu l’apprendras à tes dépens.
C’est depuis ce jour que si l’on continue à chasser les animaux, on le fait avec raison.",French,Mali,amine

Pourquoi le cheval ne parle-t-il pas ?
Pays de collecte : Mali.
Un conte dit en français et en bambara par Ambaga Guindo.
Au temps jadis, le cheval parlait comme nous parlons aujourd’hui. Il allait guerroyer. On ne
l’égorgeait pas pour le manger. À cette époque là, il y avait un village interdit aux femmes. Celles
qui essayaient d’y pénétrer périssaient.
Yassama était la fille du roi, elle était belle et séduisante. Quand elle portait un costume
d’homme, elle prenait l’apparence d’un homme. Un jour, elle décida de se rendre dans ce
village, ce fameux village interdit aux femmes. Malgré la protestation de ses parents, elle
s’entêta. Un matin, elle s’habilla comme les cavaliers, monta sur un cheval et partit avec ses
frères.
Quand ils rentrèrent dans le village, le fétiche du village s’écria :
- Hakoi ! hakoi ! Parmi ces étrangers il y a une femme, faites-les tous sortir de notre village car il
est souillé et un malheur va nous frapper.
- On fit venir les étrangers chez le chef du village, mais personne ne vit de femme parmi eux.
Le fétiche cria une nouvelle fois :
- Hakoi, faites sortir ces étrangers le village est souillé, un malheur va nous frapper.
- Vite, les villageois trouvèrent un plan pour découvrir l’intrus.
Le cheval dit alors à Yassama :
- Gare à toi, ils cherchent à te découvrir. S’ils te donnent de l’eau pour te laver ne prend pas
l’eau chaude. S’ils t’offrent de la viande ne mange pas la viande cuite.
Yassama suivit intégralement les recommandations de son cheval et échappa au piège.
À la fin de leur séjour, les villageois organisèrent une course de chevaux au cours de laquelle
Yassama les battit tous. C’est alors qu’elle montra ses seins et dit qu’elle était une femme. On la
poursuivit, mais on ne put la rattraper. Le fétiche du village se transforma en pluie pour
l’atteindre. Son cheval enleva sa peau pour la protéger car elle deviendrait stérile si cette pluie
la mouillait.
Toute joyeuse, elle rentra avec ses frères à la maison. Mais quand son père lui demanda de
raconter son voyage, elle expliqua que le cheval n’avait rien fait et qu’elle s’était débrouillée
toute seule. C’est alors que le cheval hennit et cessa de parler à cause de l’ingratitude de cette
femme.",French,Mali,amine

Dieu l’enferma donc dans une case comme convenu.

mangues mûres, régimes de bananes, bleu du ciel, étendue d’eau, une lumière dorée, des
branches qui se balançaient.
Alors, de toute sa force, le singe défonça la porte et dit :
- Le monde s’embellit alors que je suis en prison ! Pas question, tous ces mouvements de dehors
m’invitent à la fête, j’y vais, j’y vais !!!

Quand le lion épousa la brebis
Pays de collecte : Mali.
Un conte dit en français par Ousmane Diarra.
Le lion, un jour, quitta la brousse et vint en ville où il se maria avec une brebis qu’il ramena avec
lui dans la forêt. Tous les animaux fêtèrent l’événement à grands frais, et la nouvelle se répandit
bien vite, comme un feu de brousse.
- Un lion, épouser une brebis ! Quel scandale et quelle honte ! répétaient les animaux.
À ces critiques faites à basse voix le lion répondait tout haut :
- Et pourtant, j’aime beaucoup ma femme brebis.
Cependant, seule l’hyène, profondément en choc, réfléchissait :
- Malgré tout ce qu’on pense de moi, je vais quand même montrer que les qualificatifs de lâche
et de poltron qu’on m’attribue ne sont que purs mensonges et viles médisances.
Elle vint trouver le lion chez lui, à la tombée du jour :
- Majesté Lion, dit-elle, il est clair pour tout le monde que tu es le plus respectueux, le plus
majestueux de tous les animaux de la terre, mais tu as pris comme épouse une sorte d’individu
niais et bête qui ne lève jamais la tête même vers le ciel qui l’a accueilli.
- Vraiment, tu ne mérites pas pareille épouse, tu fais traîner ton nom dans la boue, dévorons-la
donc et laisse-moi ensuite aller te chercher une femme digne de ta grandeur !
Je ne dévorerai pas ma femme car je l’aime, et j’ordonne que tes propos s’arrêtent là !
L’hyène s’en alla toute honteuse.
La nuit suivante, l’hyène revint cette fois en courant bien vite, à grandes enjambées.
- Ah ! Ah ! Majesté
- As-tu appris ce que j’ai appris ?
- Quoi donc ? dit le lion.
- Il paraît que lorsque l’eau de pluie touche à la peau des brebis, il y a une maladie qu’on appelle
la gale qui leur enlève tous les poils jusqu’aux oreilles et aux pattes, elle leur tanne la peau
jusqu’à la chair rouge, une sorte de le lèpre, quoi ! Cette lèpre s’attaque aussitôt à son conjoint
et lui cause les mêmes maux. Tu te vois toi, sans crinière et sans cils, sans pelage et sans queue,
la peau tannée jusqu’à la chair comme un poulet plumé, avec des mouches partout ?
- Ah bon, s’écrit le lion !
- Et bien Hyène, à y réfléchir je vois que celle-ci n’est véritablement pas ma femme. On devra
donc, au plus tard, ce soir par tous les moyens et par toutes voies, la dévorer.
L’hyène toute contente s’en alla.
Et le soir, la brebis n’était au courant de rien. Quand elle est rentrée à la maison une vieille
femme la vit :
- Brebis, prends garde, car l’hyène que tu vois chez toi et que tu honores et respectes veut, en
réalité, ta peau. Aujourd’hui elle y a réussit. Ne va donc pas là-bas car ils t’attendent tous les
deux pour t’écorcher et te croquer. Cependant viens que je te propose une ruse qui te
permettra d’être sauvée. Car moi, je suis vieille et pleine d’expérience.
La vieille femme donna à la brebis une petite calebasse pleine de miel et lui confia un secret. La
brebis poursuivit son chemin.
Elle entra, salua et sauta par dessus les jambes étalées de son mari.
- Sacrilège ! cria le lion. Quel irrespect ! Quel déshonneur ! Pourquoi donc as-tu fais cela ?
- Pardonne-moi cher mari, Dieu seul sait que je ne l’ai pas fait exprès !",French,Mali,amine

- Ah non, s’écria l’hyène, le saut d’une femme par-dessus un homme porte toujours malheur ;
car nous avons vu seulement avant-hier, un homme dont la femme lui était passée dessus,
mourir aussitôt. Il ne s’est pas passé deux minutes qu’il trépassa le pauvre.
- Ah bon, s’écria le lion qui sauta d’un grand bon sur sa femme, mais avant que ses pattes ne
touchent le sol la brebis eut le temps de jeter dans la gueule du lion la petite calebasse de miel
que lui avait donné la vieille femme.
Le lion s’assit sur son derrière en soupirant de jouissance :
- Dis moi chère épouse, ou donc as-tu eu ce breuvage ?
- Il y a, dans la forêt d’à-côté, tes collègues lions comme toi, qui ont assemblé toutes les hyènes
pour leur presser le ventre afin de le faire sortir par leur derrière ce liquide dont ils remplissent
des outres entières. Sache que c’est du miel et que chaque hyène en a le ventre plein.
- Hyène tu me caches de si bonnes choses, je jure que tu n’emporteras pas l’outre de miel que
tu couves.
Le lion rattrapa l’hyène, il la souleva bien haut, et la lança par terre en pressant bien fort sur son
ventre. Il n’en sortit évidemment pas de miel, mais en sortit de petites crottes nauséabondes,
des morceaux d’os et aussi des graines de goyaves et des noyaux de mangues. Le lion dévora
l’hyène. Ainsi finissent tous les mouchards.
Malgré cela, il y avait de l’amour, même des amours impossibles comme celles du lion et de la
brebis, que la guerre et la misère.",French,Mali,amine

Un conte dit en français et en bambara par Ambaga Guindo.
Un garçon partit un jour loin de chez lui. Il voulait apprendre la sagesse. Arrivé dans la forêt
profonde, il entendit le cri d’un oiseau. To-cou-lo-cou, to-cou-lo-cou, to-cou-lo-cou ! Comme il
avait faim, il chercha l’oiseau, le trouva et le tua avec sa fronde.
En grillant sa viande, une idée de sagesse lui passa par la tête : « Si cet oiseau n’avait pas crié, tu
ne l’aurais pas découvert et tué. C’est la preuve que la parole tue ». Il décide alors fermement
de ne plus parler jusqu’à son retour chez ses parents.
Il continue son chemin et rencontre des femmes chargées de fagots de bois qui rentrent au
village. Elles lui demandent :
- Où vas-tu garçon ?
L’enfant ne répond pas. Elles concluent donc que c’est un sourd muet égaré et le conduisent
chez le chef du village. La nuit, le chef le couche à côté de sa plus jeune femme et de son bébé.
Dans la nuit profonde arrive l’amant de la femme. Aussitôt il veut s’en aller car cette présence
étrangère le gêne.
- Ne t’inquiètes pas, le rassure la femme. C’est un enfant égaré sourd-muet que nous avons
ramené des champs.
Le garçon ne dort pas mais fait semblant. Les amoureux causent jusqu’au premier chant du coq.
Sur le chemin du retour, l’amant se rend compte qu’il a oublié son fusil et retourne le chercher.
Dans la précipitation, il prend l’arme par le canon, le fusil étant mal saisi, tombe à terre et une
détente se produit, le bébé touché meurt.
- Rentre vite chez toi, conseille la femme, quand tu seras loin, je crierai que ce sourd muet a tué
mon bébé.
Ainsi dit, ainsi fait. L’enfant est amené pieds et poings liés. Son cou doit être tranché dans les
minutes qui suivent. Il prend alors la parole pour être son propre avocat :
- Écoutez, bonnes gens, je ne suis ni un sourd-muet, ni un assassin, je suis simplement un
amoureux de la sagesse. Je suis à la recherche de la sagesse et j’ai vu ceci : un oiseau mourir
pour avoir parlé. Depuis, j’ai opté pour le mutisme. Comme je constate que le silence peut aussi
conduire à la mort, je vais donc tout vous dire.

L’élection d’un ministre

Le lion a depuis la nuit des temps régné seul. Il a toujours imposé sa loi en despote. Or un jour, il
décide d’adopter une nouvelle façon de gouverner et de nommer un vizir à ses côtés. Il ne

décisions et à la gérance des biens de notre Royaume. J'ai donc décidé de nommer un vizir, ce

ont les yeux tournés du côté de l'Est, tous excepté le hérisson qui regarde du côté opposé et
s’expose à la risée de l’assemblée. Tandis que règne un silence pesant et une tension extrême,
une petite voix s’élève :
- Le voici ! Le voici ! Voici le soleil Votre Majesté !
Toutes les têtes se tournent du côté de la voix. La surprise des animaux est grande lorsqu'ils
voient le Roi féliciter l'ingénieux hérisson qui a remporté le concours. En effet, il a vu le reflet

La chatte imprudente
Pays de collecte : Maroc.
Un conte dit en français par Ahmed Bouzzine et en arabe marocain par Mustapha Ghanim.
Auteur : Tarik Hbid.
Il était une fois un jeune homme du nom d’Hamidi qui habitait une toute petite cabane dans un
village, très haut perché dans la montagne. Il vivait seul et sa seule compagnie était une jolie
petite chatte. Dès que le soleil se levait, il se rendait dans la grande forêt et là il cherchait de
quoi vivoter mais surtout de quoi nourrir la petite chatte. Il ne revenait qu’une fois le soleil
couché. La chatte enfermée toute la journée trouvait le temps long et l’ennui commençait à la
gagner. Il n’y avait plus depuis longtemps une souris, un scarabée, ou une mouche à chasser. Ce
jour-là elle trouva un autre jeu. Elle monta sur la table et avec sa patte fit tomber l’assiette où il
y avait le repas de son maitre, elle renversa la jarre de lait de son maitre et se régala avec ce
qu’elle avait renversé. Puis satisfaite, se lécha les babines, les pattes et attendit son maitre.
Ce jour-là, Hamidi rentra de la forêt et dans sa musette il n’avait rien à se mettre sous la dent.
Mais se disait-t-il, j’ai un petit repas qui m’attend chez moi.
Quand il ouvrit la porte, qu’il vit toute sa vaisselle cassée et son repas par terre, il fut pris d’une
terrible colère.
- Maudit chat ! Je me fatigue pour te trouver à manger et toi tu souilles ma seule nourriture de la
journée ! Tu vas voir ce que tu vas voir.
Il attrapa la chatte, se saisit d’un petit couteau et là… couic ! D’un petit coup il lui coupa le bout
de la queue et l’accrocha sur un mur. Et toujours furieux il lui dit :
- Tu peux pleurer jour et nuit, verser un lac de larmes ! Je ne te rendrai ta queue que si tu remplis
de nouveau ma jarre de lait.
Dès le lendemain la chatte se réveilla tôt et se mit en chemin. Elle traversa la grande forêt, arriva
dans une grande prairie et vit une vache, elle lui chanta :
- La vache, la vache, la vache, donne-moi du bon lait, pour remplir la jarre que j’ai, la jarre que
j’ai renversée, et récupérer ma queue, que mon maitre a coupée.
- Je veux bien t’aider !, lui dit la vache mais moi pour donner du lait, il me faut de l’herbe !
Elle courut trouver une prairie.
- Prairie, prairie, prairie donne-moi de l’herbe, que je donnerai à la vache, qui me donnera du bon
lait, pour remplir la jarre que j’ai, la jarre que j’ai renversée, et récupérer ma queue que mon
maitre a coupée.
- Je suis toute assoiffée, toute desséchée, trouve moi de l’eau et je donnerai de la bonne herbe.
La chatte trouva un petit ruisseau et lui chanta :
- Ruisseau, ruisseau, ruisseau donne moi de la bonne eau, que je donnerai à la prairie, qui me
donnera de l’herbe, que je donnerai à la vache, qui me donnera du bon lait, pour remplir la jarre
que j’ai, la jarre que j’ai renversée, et récupérer ma queue, que mon maitre a coupée.
- Je ne suis qu’un petit ruisseau, il faudrait que la grande rivière me donne un peu de son eau.
La chatte trouva la rivière et lui chanta :
- Rivière, rivière, rivière donne-moi de ton eau, que je donnerai au ruisseau, qui me donnera de
l’eau, que je donnerai à la prairie, qui me donnera de l’herbe, que je donnerai à la vache, qui me
donnera du bon lait, pour remplir la jarre que j’ai, la jarre que j’ai renversée, et récupérer ma
queue, que mon maitre a coupée.",French,Maroc,amine

- Le ciel ne donnera plus de pluie et la rosée du matin n’y suffira pas, je ne suis qu’un mince filet
qui coule dans son lit. Seule la montagne pourrait m’offrir un peu de neige.
La petite chatte grimpa, grimpa, jusqu’au sommet tout blanc de la montagne. Elle avait si froid
et de sa petite voix elle susurra :
- Montagne, montagne, montagne, donne-moi un peu de neige, que je donnerai à la rivière, qui
me donnera de son eau, que je donnerai au ruisseau, qui me donnera de l’eau, que je donnerai à
la prairie, qui me donnera de l’herbe, que je donnerai à la vache, qui me donnera du bon lait,
pour remplir la jarre que j’ai, la jarre que j’ai renversée, et récupérer ma queue, que mon maitre
a coupée.
- Je suis désolée, lui dit la montagne, je dois garder ma glace jusqu’à l’été, descend et attend que
le soleil soit ardent.
La chatte descendit, le cœur gros. Voilà… se dit-elle ma grosse bêtise a de graves conséquences :
je suis une chatte sans queue, qui n’ose plus se montrer, de peur d’être moquée.
- J’ai faim ! Hamidi mon maitre a eu raison d’être furieux ! Ça fait mal d’avoir faim. La prochaine
fois j’y regarderai à deux fois avant de faire des bêtises.
La chatte était très triste. Elle s’allongea, s’enroulant sur elle-même et attendit que la montagne
daigne laisser fondre la neige.
Les semaines passèrent, les lunes passèrent, les saisons passèrent. Un beau matin la chatte
entendit le doux bruit de l’eau, la neige était en train de fondre, elle remercia la montagne. La
rivière se remplit et donna de l’eau au ruisseau qui irrigua la prairie pour donner de l’herbe
tendre à la vache qui, satisfaite, donna du bon lait. Enfin ! La chatte rempli la jarre qu’elle avait
renversée.
Elle revint chez son maitre Hamidi. Il était heureux de revoir sa compagne. Elle sauta dans ses
bras et ronronna. Hamidi la serra contre son cœur et lui recolla la queue.
Devant sa porte il trouva la jarre pleine de lait. Et la vie redevint comme avant.

Le garçon aux grandes oreilles
Pays de collecte : Maroc.
Un conte dit en français par Bahija Ben Barka et en arabe marocain par Mustapha Ghanim.
Auteur : Mohamed Bahi.
Il était une fois dans un pays lointain, très lointain, un hakem (gouverneur). Il avait un garçon qui
avait de longues oreilles. Comme ce dernier en avait honte, il les cachait avec une calotte. Si
cette tare s’ébruite, il sera la risée de tout le monde. C’est pourquoi son père faisait appel à un
coiffeur pour lui faire couper les cheveux, à domicile, loin des regards indiscrets.
Mais un jour, le coiffeur, rongé par la curiosité, voulut savoir pourquoi le garçon avait de longues
oreilles. C’est ainsi qu’il commit l’irréparable ! On le laissa couper les cheveux, puis on lui coupa
la tête pour qu’il ne révèle pas le secret. Les coiffeurs se succédèrent et posèrent la même
question, et leurs têtes sautèrent après qu’ils coupèrent les cheveux du fils du gouverneur.
Un jour, on fit venir un coiffeur, qu’on dit discret. Il vit les grandes oreilles de l’enfant, mais ne
chercha pas à savoir pourquoi. Il coupa les cheveux. Mais avant qu’il s’en aille, le père lui
recommanda de garder le secret s’il ne voulait pas se faire décapiter.
Le coiffeur rentra chez lui décontenancé car le secret qu’il détenait prenait de l’ampleur et le
gonflait petit à petit si bien que son corps devint trop lourd. Pour se libérer de ce poids qui
l’écrasait depuis de nombreux jours, il se rendit dans un puits et cria en se penchant vers le vide
: « le fils du gouverneur a de grandes oreilles ! Le fils du gouverneur a de grandes oreilles ! Le fils
du gouverneur a de grandes oreilles ! » La grenouille l’entendit et se mit à crier elle aussi : « le
fils du gouverneur a de grandes oreilles ! Le fils du gouverneur a de grandes oreilles ! Le fils du
gouverneur a de grandes oreilles ». Le pigeon venu se désaltérer, près du puits, l’entendit et se
mit à dire : « le fils du gouverneur a de grandes oreilles, le fils du gouverneur a de grandes
oreilles, le fils du gouverneur a de grandes oreilles ». Le corbeau l’entendit et se met à crier la
même chose. Les autres oiseaux l’entendirent et se mirent à répéter : « le fils du gouverneur a
de grandes oreilles ! ». La nouvelle se répandit dans la ville et arriva aux oreilles du gouverneur.
Furieux contre le coiffeur qui avait divulgué le secret, il promit de lui faire avaler sa langue. On le
fit venir ; mais il jura et nia en avoir parlé à quelqu’un.
Le fils intervint et dit à son père que le coiffeur est sincère. Après tout, la nouvelle s’est
propagée et tout le monde est aujourd’hui au courant. Cela ne sert à rien de tuer le coiffeur. « Je
suis une créature de Dieu, je n’ai pas à rougir d’être différent des autres ». Sur ce, le coiffeur fut
lâché. Le garçon, libéré de sa hantise, sortait désormais sans calotte.

Le lion et le hérisson
Pays de collecte : Maroc.
Un conte dit en français par Bahija Ben Barka et en arabe marocain par Mustapha Ghanim.
Auteur : Mohamed Bahi.
Une fois, un lion, roi de la forêt a convoqué tous les animaux. Tous avaient répondu présents : ils
étaient là au moment et au lieu indiqué. Un seul a manqué ce rendez-vous décisif : c’est le
hérisson. Il est arrivé en retard.
Le lion, en colère, lui demande la raison de ce retard.
- J’avais des courses à faire et quelques affaires à régler, répond la petite voix.
- Quelle arrogance ! Tu ne respectes plus personne, tu n’as plus honte.
Sur ce, le lion n’en fait qu’une bouchée et l’avale. Mais le hérisson ne se laisse pas faire. Il se
gonfle, s’enfle dans la gorge du lion et se met à manger la chair et la graisse. Le lion est pris d’un
malaise ; il tousse et vomit du sang. Alarmé par sa santé qui se dégrade, il réfléchit longuement
à sa situation. Il regrette d’avoir avalé le hérisson et le prie de sortir en lui affirmant qu’il ne lui
en veut pas et qu’il lui a pardonné son retard. Mais le hérisson ne peut pas lui faire confiance. Il
lui demande alors de prêter serment de ne pas lui faire de mal. Le lion jure. Le hérisson lui
demande alors d’ouvrir grande sa gueule et de tousser. C’est ainsi que le hérisson s’extirpe et se
jette par terre.
Sitôt libéré, le hérisson lui lance un défi. C’est ainsi qu’ils décident d’un commun accord de
s’affronter loyalement. Chacun viendra avec son armée. Le jour de la bataille arrive. Le roi des
animaux fait venir tous les lions : leurs rugissements retentissent dans toute la forêt, terrifiant
toute la faune. Comme à son habitude, le hérisson arrive un peu tard, sur le dos d’une poule
suivie de ses poussins qui remplissent la forêt de leurs caquètements et gloussements (djaou,
djaou, djaou). Il tient un sac, un ballot (abiaâ en langue berbère) plein de guêpes. Une fois arrivé
près des lions, le hérisson ouvre le sac, les guêpes se jettent sur les lions et commencent à les
piquer. Les lions mugissent, s’enfuient et se cachent tous dans une tanière.
Le hérisson, juché sur la poule suivie de ses poussins, les poursuit et se poste devant leur
cachette. Chaque fois qu’un lion sort pour voir si le hérisson et son armée sont partis, il se
tourne vers les autres lions et leur dit : « ils sont toujours là ». Avant de partir, le hérisson enlève
une plume de la queue de la poule et la met devant le trou par lequel il était épié. Chaque fois
qu’un lion s’aventure pour voir si le hérisson n’est plus là, il voit la plume que le vent agite, et se
tourne vers les autres fauves en leur disant : « son cheval (Ayss en langue berbère) est encore
là ». Les lions restent enfermés, jusqu’à ce qu’ils soient tous décimés par la faim et la soif.

Le lion malade, le hérisson et le loup
Pays de collecte : Maroc.
Un conte dit en français par Bahija Ben Barka et en arabe marocain par Mustapha Ghanim.
Auteur : Mohamed Bahi.
Il était une fois un lion, un hérisson et un loup. Un jour, le lion tombe malade. Comme il est alité,
des rumeurs inquiétantes circulent au sujet de sa santé. C’est pourquoi le hérisson propose au
loup d’aller ensemble rendre une visite de courtoisie au lion et s’enquérir de son état de santé.
Arrivés au seuil de la maison, le loup décide d’entrer le premier chez sa majesté le lion.
Par peur, par complaisance ou par imprudence, il improvise une recette médicale susceptible de
guérir le maître :
- Si vous buvez du sang de hérisson, vous serez guéri de votre maladie, bafouille-t-il.
- Mais où vais-je trouver un hérisson ? demande le lion d’une voix fatiguée.
- Il y en a un là, juste derrière la porte, s’empresse de répondre le loup.
Le lion fait entrer le hérisson, le remercie de s’être proposé pour lui venir en aide et loue
l’altruisme et le courage dont il fait preuve en acceptant de se sacrifier pour la bonne cause. Et il
ajoute : « Le loup m’a dit que ton sang est le remède de ma maladie ».
- C’est vrai, mon ami a raison, voici un peu de mon sang. Mais ce sang doit être mélangé avec la
cervelle d’un loup pour être efficace. C’est d’ailleurs la raison pour laquelle nous sommes venus
ensemble.
- Mais où vais-je trouver le loup ? Il vient de partir !
Le hérisson le rassure sur un ton calme : « il est encore derrière la porte, il attend votre décision
; c’est l’un de vos plus fidèles serviteurs et n’hésitera sûrement pas à vous rendre service ». Le
lion appelle le loup et lui demande de revenir. Il s’adresse à lui : « Voici le sang du hérisson, mais
il me semble qu’il doit être mélangé avec ta cervelle ». Sur ce, le lion, impatient de retrouver ses
forces, se jette sur le loup et le dévore. Sous ses crocs, la cervelle dégouline.",French,Maroc,amine

Le loup et le hérisson
Pays de collecte : Maroc.
Un conte dit en français par Ahmed Bouzzine et en arabe marocain par Mustapha Ghanim.
Auteur : Aicha Ait Berri.
Cette histoire se passe il y a très longtemps, du temps où le chat jouait avec la souris et le soleil
avec la lune.
En ce temps là, le loup et Boumghar le hérisson étaient de très bons amis. Ils avaient décidé de
travailler la terre ensemble et de partager la récolte de ce champ au grain de blé près.
Un champ ce n’est pas grand pour un loup mais pour un hérisson c’est grand comme un océan.
Après le premier jour des labours, Boumghar, le plus malin de tous les animaux, était si harassé
par ce travail qu’il se dit qu’il allait mourir épuisé.
De retour chez lui, fatigué, il réfléchit.
- Un loup, se dit-il, travaille sans fatigue au moins cent fois plus qu’un hérisson. Donc il va
s’occuper tout seul de notre champ !
Et durant la nuit, le rusé hérisson réfléchit à un stratagème.
Le lendemain matin, il grimpa au sommet de la falaise qui surplombait leur champ. Là vivaient
des perdrix. Il leur dit :
- Perdrix, perdrix, jolies perdrix, si vous me voyez danser, n’hésitez pas à jeter des pierres sur le
loup ! Mais si vous me voyez contre la falaise, cessez aussitôt ! En échange je vous donnerai un
sac plein de blé.
Une fois dans le champ, le hérisson se mit à danser et une pluie de cailloux s’abattit sur le loup.
Il cria effrayé :
- Aïe, ouille, ouille, aïe, aïe, aïe! Nous allons tous mourir, il faut nous enfuir tout de suite ! La
falaise nous tombe dessus et la terre va s’ouvrir !
Le hérisson s’arrêta de danser et les perdrix ne jetèrent plus aucun caillou.
- Arrête de claquer des dents Loup ! Ce n’est rien, je vais arranger ce problème. Tu ne me
connais pas, grâce à ma force phénoménale, je vais soutenir cette falaise.
Abasourdi, le loup n’en croyait pas ses oreilles.
Le hérisson malicieux, se cala contre la falaise et les cailloux cessèrent de rouler. Le loup tout
ébahi, n’en croyait pas ses yeux.
- Pendant que je la retiens, dépêche-toi de labourer notre terre !
Encore tout étonné, il mit toute son ardeur à retourner le champ. Quand il fut très fatigué, il
demanda au hérisson de venir pousser la charrue. Suspicieux, il se disait que si un hérisson
pouvait soutenir une falaise, pourquoi pas lui. Peut-être que son ami est un prétentieux.
- Pas de problème ! Je te laisse volontiers ma place car ce travail est vraiment très épuisant !, lui
dit Boumghar.
Le loup prit la place du hérisson. Boumghar, derrière la charrue, se mit à danser. À peine le loup
eut calé son dos contre la falaise qu’à nouveau une pluie de pierres s’abattit dans un fracas
assourdissant.
- Allez le loup, pousse plus fort ! Plus fort encore !, hurla le hérisson dansant.
Le loup avait beau y mettre tout son cœur et toutes ses forces, cela ne changeait rien. Les
chutes des pierres ne cessaient pas. Le loup tout haletant et tout transpirant se rendit à la",French,Maroc,amine

raison. Il n’était pas aussi fort que Boumghar pour empêcher cette falaise de s’écrouler. Il
préférait encore labourer. Il appela son ami à la rescousse.
- Reprends vite ta place, moi je ne m’occuperai plus que du champ ! Mais avant de reprendre le
travail, révèle-moi le secret de ta force phénoménale.
- Ma force est un don de Dieu. Je suis sous la protection de tous les saints.
- Mais que faut-il que je fasse pour être comme toi ?
- Pour être comme moi, c’est très facile : tu dois toujours aider ton prochain ainsi que ceux qui
sont dans le besoin.
- C’est tout ?
- Non tu dois avoir le cœur sur la main et garder les secrets que l’on te confie. As-tu compris
maintenant ?
- Oui, oui ! dit le loup
- J’ai enfin tout compris.
Mais il n’avait rien compris.
Et c’est ainsi que le loup retourna toute la terre. Il ratissa le champ, puis il sema le blé.
Et tous deux n’avaient plus qu’à attendre que la pluie passe et que le blé se mette à pousser.
Quand arriva le moment de partager la récolte, le rusé Boumghar se souvint de la promesse
faite aux perdrix. Ce matin-là, il vint au rendez-vous avec un couffin qui semblait lourd.
Il dit au loup qu’il désirait prendre la moitié de la récolte plus un sac sous prétexte que son
travail était bien plus épuisant et bien plus dangereux que celui du loup.
- Pas question !, lui dit le loup, nos tâches étaient équitables. J’ai bien travaillé notre champ et
toi tu as empêché la falaise de s’écrouler. Voilà chacun sa spécialité.
Ils discutèrent, négocièrent âprement. Après moult tractations, Boumghar fatigué lui dit :
- D’accord, d’accord, on va faire moitié-moitié et partager équitablement. Scellons notre accord
de cette manière. Tu répèteras ces paroles après moi et tu donneras un grand coup de pied dans
ce couffin.
- Par le coup de pied dans le sac, je prends ma part tout en vrac.
- Par le coup de pied dans le sac, je prends ma part tout en vrac.
Joignant la parole au  geste, le loup donna un grand coup de pieds dans le couffin. Aussitôt
surgit un énorme chien qui bondit à ses trousses. Le loup ne demanda pas son reste et plus vite
que son ombre, il disparut.
Boumghar le rusé profita de toute la récolte. Il n’oublia pas sa promesse. Il ramena un sac de blé
aux perdrix.

Le pigeon, le loup et la cigogne
Pays de collecte : Maroc.
Un conte dit en français par Ahmed Bouzzine et en arabe marocain par Mustapha Ghanim.
Auteur : Mohamed Bahi.
Sur la plus haute branche d’un arbre, il y avait un nid et dans ce nid vivaient une pigeonne et ses
pigeonneaux. Un jour, un loup à l’estomac vide et à la langue pendante remarqua le nid de la
mère pigeon et sa couvée. Cela lui mit l’eau à la bouche et de sa grosse voix il dit :
- Tante pigeonne, j’ai très, très faim ! Offre-moi vite un de tes petits enfants sinon tu goûteras
ma furie. J’hurlerai, je gronderai, je mugirai et je soufflerai sur ton arbre, il se cassera et toi et
tes petits je vous mangerai sans vous déplumer d’une seule bouchée.
Terrifiée, la pigeonne tremblait de tout son corps, paniquée, elle sacrifia un de ses pigeonneaux
pour protéger ses autres enfants. D’une bouchée, le loup l’avala, il se pourlécha les babines et se
dit qu’il avait trouvé là un délicieux garde-manger.
Le lendemain, il revint au pied de l’arbre et de sa terrible voix dit :
Tante pigeonne, j’ai encore très, très faim ! Offre-moi vite un de tes petits sinon tu goûteras à
ma furie. J’hurlerai, je gronderai, je mugirai et je soufflerai sur ton arbre, il se cassera et toi et
tes petits je vous mangerai d’une seule bouchée.
Glacée d’effroi, elle se résolu, les larmes au cœur, à sacrifier un autre pigeonneau. Sans pitié,
d’une bouchée, le loup l’avala. Il se pourlécha les babines et se dit qu’il avait trouvé là un
délicieux garde-manger.
La pauvre maman ne savait plus que faire. Les larmes aux yeux, désemparée, elle quitta son nid
et se posa au milieu d’un champ. Ses larmes coulaient abondamment sur son jabot, la pauvre
pigeonne se lamentait toujours et encore sur son sort. Une cigogne survola le champ et entendit
la complainte de l’oiseau. Curieuse et intriguée, elle se posa près de la mère pigeonne.
- Pauvre cousine, quelle est donc la raison de cette grande tristesse ?
- Un grand malheur s’est abattu sur ma famille. Tous les jours le loup nous menace moi et mes
enfants. De sa méchante voix il me dit :
- Tante pigeonne, j’ai encore très, très faim ! Offre-moi vite un de tes petits sinon tu goûteras à
ma furie. J’hurlerai, je gronderai, je mugirai et je soufflerai sur ton arbre, il se cassera et toi et
tes petits je vous mangerai d’une seule bouchée. À chaque fois j’ai obéi et j’ai sacrifié un de mes
petits. Il ne m’en reste pas beaucoup.
La cigogne éclata de rire et lui dit :
- Idiote que tu es ! A-t-on déjà vu un loup souffler un arbre ? A-t-on déjà vu un loup casser un
arbre ? A-t-on déjà vu un loup grimper à un arbre ? Non ! Alors écoute mon conseil. Quand il
reviendra dis-lui qu’il peut hurler, gronder, mugir, souffler tant qu’il le voudra, surtout ne fais
rien. Tout ce que je viens de te dire est un secret. Ne lui dis rien.
Le jour suivant, le loup revint au pied de l’arbre et entonna son refrain :
- Tante pigeonne, j’ai toujours très faim ! Offre-moi vite un de tes petits, sinon tu goûteras à ma
furie. J’hurlerai, je gronderai, je mugirai et je soufflerai sur ton arbre, il se cassera et toi et tes
petits je vous mangerai d’une seule bouchée.
La pigeonne prit tout son courage, gonfla son jabot et d’un air moqueur lui répondit :
- Pauvre loup ! Tu peux hurler, gronder, mugir et souffler autant que tu le voudras, tu n’auras
rien ! Tu veux mes petits, grimpe sur cet arbre si tu le peux !",French,Maroc,amine

- Houps !
Le loup n’en croyait pas ses oreilles.
- Dis-moi qui t’as dit de me répondre comme ça ?
- Ma cousine la cigogne m’a fait jurer de ne rien dire !
- La Cigogne !
Le loup était affamé. Il s’allongea sous l’arbre. Il avait la langue qui pendait et de la mousse lui
sortait par les trous de nez. Quand il retrouva un peu de force, il décida de s’occuper de la
maudite cigogne. Au bord du champ, il y avait une plaque de ciment. Sur cette plaque, il vomit
toute l’écume qu’il lui restait encore dans son estomac. De loin il aperçut la cigogne qui
l’observait. Il l’appela.
- Cigogne, chère cigogne ! Que je suis heureux de te revoir, cela faisait si longtemps ! Je suis
tellement en joie que je t’offre ce repas.
Méfiante, la cigogne s’approcha de quelques pas.
- Allez ! Approche, regarde ce bon repas ! Il est pour toi !
N’ayant plus aucune crainte, elle s’avança encore de quelques pas, allongea son long coup et
picora les vomissures et tout ce que le loup avait régurgité. Elle se régalait.
Soudain le loup se jeta sur la cigogne, l’attrapa, la coinça entre ses grosses pattes et de sa
méchante voix lui dit :
- Cigogne trop bavarde ! Tu vas payer pour tes mauvais conseils. À cause de toi la pigeonne ne
m’offre plus ses petits. J’avais trouvé là un délicieux garde-manger. Maintenant c’est toi qui va le
remplacer. Je vais te déplumer et te dévorer !
- Me manger ! Mais regarde-moi ! Je n’ai que de la peau sur les os. En revanche je connais un
endroit où  la nourriture coule en abondance. Si tu montais sur mon dos, je t’y emmènerai.
Aussitôt dit, aussitôt fait. Le loup grimpa sur le dos de la cigogne et tous deux s’envolèrent très
haut dans les cieux.
La cigogne interrogea le loup :
- Que vois-tu en dessous?
- En dessous ! Je vois un immense champ de blé.
La cigogne, de quelques battements d’ailes, vola encore plus haut.
- Et loup que vois-tu maintenant ?
- La terre est devenue comme un tapis !
La cigogne vola encore plus haut. Elle avait atteint le firmament du ciel.
- Et maintenant ?
- Houuu la la ! J’ai le vertige.
- Mais que vois-tu ?
-  Un plat de tagine !
- Nous avons trouvé le plat ! Il nous reste à trouver la nourriture, lui répondit la cigogne.
- Et maintenant qu’aperçois-tu tout en bas ?
- Je vois une petite lentille bleue.
Elle était arrivée au-dessus de l’océan, de son regard perçant elle apercevait l’écume blanche
des vagues. La mer était déchainée. Mais le loup n’entendait rien et ne voyait rien.
- Vois-tu sur cette petite lentille, il y a de la belle mousse blanche ? C’est une crème délicieuse
qui coule sans fin, lui dit la cigogne.",French,Maroc,amine

Le loup en avait l’eau à la bouche. La cigogne lui dit :
- Nous allons descendre ! Desserre tes pattes autour de mon cou et je me poserai.
À peine le loup desserra-t-il son étreinte que la cigogne se retourna, vola sur le dos. Le loup
tomba. Dans un hurlement sans fin, il tombait, tombait, tombait. Du haut du ciel, elle vit pauvre
animal qui se débattait dans une mer déchainée. Il disparut.
De retour sur la terre ferme, la cigogne, fâchée, retourna voir la pigeonne et la questionna.
- Ingrate ! Pourquoi n’as-tu pas gardée notre secret ? À cause de toi j’ai failli être mangée moi
aussi !
Toute honteuse, le regard baissé la pigeonne lui répondit d’une petite voix :
- Mille excuses ma cousine. Quoi que je fasse, devant le loup je perds tous mes moyens. Je n’ai
pas pu me retenir de lui dire la vérité. Ne me confie plus de secret.
- La vérité est que tu me fais pitié. Et je n’aurai plus confiance en toi.
La cigogne s’envola et oublia vite cette histoire. Quant à la pigeonne, une fois que ses petits
volèrent de leurs propres ailes, elle raconta cette terrible histoire à toutes ses amies.

Le teigneux
Pays de collecte : Maroc.

Il était une fois un homme appelé « Harmajjoud », « le teigneux rusé », connu pour sa malice et
ses fourberies. Un jour, une vieille femme l’engagea comme berger. Le contrat de travail devait
expirer à la fin du mois de mars, période à laquelle l’oiseau « dikou » envahit l’espace de ses cris,
pique et excite les bovins.
Harmajjoud n’hésita pas à abuser de la confiance de sa maîtresse. Il avait vendu toutes les
vaches après leur avoir coupé la queue. Ensuite, il repéra un terrain marécageux et y planta les
queues. Et puis il courut retrouver la vieille. Haletant, il lui dit :
- C’est horrible ! Oh là là ! Quelle catastrophe Madame ! Si tu savais…
- Raconte ! Au nom de Dieu !
- C’est horrible, toutes les vaches se sont aventurées dans un terrain marécageux ; elles se sont
enfoncées dans la boue, il n’y a plus que les queues qui sont visibles. Viens voir, c’est vraiment
incroyable !
La vieille se lamenta sur son sort et celui de ses vaches. Au bout d’un moment, elle se résigna et
se dit : « ce qui devait arriver arrive, on n’y peut rien ».
Une fois l’argent de la vente des bovins dépensé, il s’attaqua aux autres têtes de bétail. La vieille
femme n’avait pas besoin de compter pour s’apercevoir que le nombre de ses bêtes était en
diminution. Elle se voyait impotente et complètement ruinée ! C’est ainsi qu’elle réfléchit à une
ruse qui la débarrasserait de ce filou. Elle était pressée de le congédier mais le contrat était clair
: elle devait attendre la fin du mois de mars. Dans l’espoir de faire croire à son berger que le
contrat était arrivé à terme, elle grimpa sur un arbre et pendant un long moment elle s’évertua
à imiter le cri de l’oiseau qui annonce le printemps : « dicoo, dicoo, dicoo… ! ».
Le berger tendit l’oreille et repéra le lieu d’où venait le cri. Il resta sceptique.
- Comme il est étrange le cri de ce volatile ! Son cri s’apparente à celui du hibou !
Pour tirer l’affaire au clair, il ramassa une pierre, la plaça dans sa fronde qu’il fit tournoyer avant
de viser l’arbre. Il s’en suivit un fracas et un gémissement terrifiant. Au même instant, une
masse se détacha de l’arbre et s’écrasa au sol dans un bruit mat. Il se mit à sauter en se répétant
ce dicton : « le hibou qui ne s’est pas envolé n’en est pas un ».",French,Maroc,amine

Les deux loups affamés
Pays de collecte : Maroc.
Un conte dit en français par Ahmed Bouzzine et en arabe marocain par Mustapha Ghanim.
Auteur : Ahmed Hafdi.
Il était une fois deux loups, deux loups qui avaient terriblement faim.
Ils ne trouvaient rien à se mettre sous leurs terribles crocs. Ils en avaient perdu le sommeil.
Cette nuit-là, ils étaient d’accord pour changer d’endroit. Toujours aux aguets, ils marchaient à pas
de loups, les oreilles dressées, ils écoutaient le moindre bruit, flairaient la moindre odeur.
Soudain un des loups sursauta, regarda l’autre loup et lui dit :
- As-tu entendu, comme moi, le chant d’un coq là-bas dans la forêt ?
- J’ai entendu le chant d’un coq, mais je crois que ce ne sont que des hallucinations !
- Chut ! Tais-toi ! Tu entends bien le chant d’un coq !
- C’est vrai, tu as raison ! Cette fois-ci mes oreilles ne l’ont pas inventé ! Ce n’est pas un mirage. Mais
notre problème c’est que ces volatiles sont souvent perchés sur les arbres.
- Tentons notre chance, peut-être que nous serons assez malin pour l’attraper !
Ils mirent le chemin de la forêt sous leurs pattes.
À l’orée du bois, le second loup qui avait très peur du noir, décida d’abandonner là.
Le premier loup lui, n’hésita pas. Il s’enfonça dans les broussailles. Il était sans doute plus affamé ou
plus audacieux que son ami. Il cherchait de bosquets en bosquets.
Arrivé dans la clairière, il aperçut enfin un coq chantant perché sur le sommet d’un arbre.
- Bonjour Monsieur le Coq ! Vous êtes le roi des muezzins ! Mon désir serait que vous descendiez et
que l’on partage une prière ensemble.
- Désolé cher loup ! Je n’ai pas encore fait mes ablutions. Mais un peu plus loin là-bas au pied de cet
arbre, un ami qui m’est cher sera heureux de prier avec toi. N’hésites pas à le réveiller !
Le loup se précipita vers l’arbre que lui avait indiqué le coq. Il se pourléchait les babines.
- Enfin quelque chose à se mettre sous la dent ! pensa-t-il.
Sa joie fut de courte durée. À peine arrivé  près de l’arbre, surgit un chien de chasse.
Le loup aurait voulu prendre ses jambes à son cou mais il était trop tard. La peur le paralysait. La
queue basse, le regard méfiant, il dit :
- Voudriez-vous priez avec moi ?
- Ô Pauvre de moi, je voudrais bien ! Mais j’ai un terrible mal de tête ! Surtout quand je vois un
loup !
- Je sais ce qui peut guérir votre mal de tête !  De la cervelle ! Ça tombe bien j’ai laissé à l’orée du
bois une belle proie avec une grosse cervelle. Parce que moi je vous aurai bien offert la mienne mais
je l’ai perdue et je n’en ai plus !
Le chien n’était pas d’humeur à écouter ces balivernes. D’un bond il se saisit du loup et le dévora.
Quant à l’autre loup resté à l’orée du bois, il entendit un horrible cri résonner dans la forêt. Il sut
qu’un grand malheur était arrivé à son compagnon. Il était heureux de ne pas l’avoir suivi. Il leva les
yeux au ciel et vit les dattes d’un palmier. Il se dit :
- Ah ! Ces délicieuses dattes suffiraient à calmer ma faim, mais je ne sais ni grimper aux arbres, ni
bondir très haut. Je me contenterai de celles qui tombent par terre ! La gueule grande ouverte, il
attendit sous l’arbre.

Un chat vertueux
Pays de collecte : Maroc.
Un conte dit en français par Bahija Ben Barka et en arabe marocain par Mustapha Ghanim.
Auteur : Aicha Ait Berri.
Dans les temps les plus anciens, existait un chat vertueux, appelé « chat d’Ighnaïn ». Il était
connu pour sa bonté, son intégrité et sa fidélité. Il était très apprécié dans son entourage.
Comme il ne pouvait pas s’acquitter des travaux assumés par les hommes, la famille qui l’avait
adopté l’affecta aux courses. Un jour d’été, il fût chargé d’apporter le déjeuner aux
moissonneurs. Dans son panier, il avait une grande quantité de nourriture : pain, huile, beurre,
miel, lait… Sur son chemin, il tomba sur un hérisson qui semblait souffrir. Il marchait
péniblement en poussant des gémissements de douleur : « aïe, aïe, aïe… ». Il s’apitoya sur son
sort, s’approcha de lui et lui proposa son aide :
- Que puis-je pour vous ?
Celui-ci, d’une petite voix à peine audible, le supplia :
- Âme charitable, je vous prie de me transporter jusqu’à ma demeure, elle est sur votre chemin.
J’ai trop mal, je n’arrive pas à marcher.
Sans hésiter, le chat se pencha sur lui, le ramassa délicatement et le posa doucement au fond du
panier. Une fois bien installé dans le panier, le hérisson se frotta les pattes. Il arbora un large
sourire et se mit à saliver. Il jubila face à un tel banquet. Ce fut avec voracité, qu’il puisa dans le
miel, le beurre… Une fois rassasié, il s’adressa à son bienfaiteur :
- Âme charitable, je vous prie de me déposer ici, je suis arrivé à destination. Je vous serai
reconnaissant toute ma vie.
Mais avant de s’en aller, feignant une révérence en signe d’adieu, il prit soin d’enduire de beurre
rance la queue du chat. Ne se doutant de rien, bercé par l’euphorie d’avoir accompli un geste
charitable, le chat continua son chemin en chantonnant : « miaou, miaouou… ». Quand ils
l’aperçurent, les moissonneurs tenaillés par la faim se précipitèrent à sa rencontre et lui
arrachèrent le panier. Dès qu’ils y jetèrent un regard, ils se figèrent et échangèrent des regards
consternés : il y avait très peu de nourriture. Ils interrogèrent le chat qui nia catégoriquement
avoir puisé dans le contenu du panier.
- Si ce n’est pas toi, qui est le coupable à ton avis ?
- Je vous jure que je ne sais pas. C’est vraiment un mystère.
Décontenancés, les moissonneurs s’approchèrent du suspect à la recherche d’un indice qui
prouve sa culpabilité. Il dût ouvrir la bouche : il n’y avait ni trace de nourriture ni odeur du
beurre. On passa au crible fin ses pattes, il n’y eut rien à signaler. Mais dès que les nez flairèrent
la queue, ils furent envahis par l’odeur du beurre rance et crièrent tous :
- C’est elle la coupable ! C’est elle la voleuse ! C’est ta queue !
Furieux contre sa queue, le chat se tourna vers elle, la secoua, lui fit mordre la poussière en lui
disant :
- Quand tu me suivais et m’obéissais, je te reconnaissais mienne. À présent, tu oses me trahir et
manger à mon insu, tu me fais honte espèce de chapardeuse. Je te renie ! Je te renie ! lui cria-t-il
fou de rage. Et d’un coup de dents, il la cisailla. Comme une ordure, il la jeta loin de lui.",French,Maroc,amine

Épouser une jolie femme c’est un gros risque
Pays de collecte : Mauritanie.
Un conte dit en français et en wolof par Mamadou Sall.
Fatouma était une belle femme, on aurait dit une perle en diamant, sucée et crachée par Dieu
en personne.
Elle habitait avec son mari Moussa, une cabane située dans la forêt, non loin de Keur Mour, mon
village. Moussa était un grand chasseur. En ce temps là toute la région faisait partie du royaume
du roi tout puissant ""Bour doley"".
Un jour, le roi ""Bour doley"" qui se promenait sur son cheval aperçoit Fatoumata, habillée d'une
robe en soie, coiffée d'un foulard assorti, assise sur le seuil de la porte de sa cabane en train de
préparer du couscous pour le repas du soir. Son mari était encore à la chasse. Le roi manqua de
tomber de son cheval en voyant cette beauté si rare. Ses courtisans l'aidèrent à continuer son
chemin. A cette époque le royaume était en guerre contre un royaume voisin. Le lendemain, le
roi Bour doley envoie le mari de Fatoumata au front.
Tous les jours qui suivent, le roi passe voir Fatoumata et lui apporte des cadeaux. Une nuit, il va
voir Fatoumata dans sa cabane et lui dit :
- Je ne peux plus m'empêcher de te le dire, je suis follement amoureux de toi, je veux que tu sois
ma maîtresse maintenant, et si ton mari ne revient pas je te prendrai comme seconde épouse.
Tu vivras dans mon palais tu seras ma reine favorite.
Fatoumata, calmement, répond :
- Sire, vous avez le droit de vie et de mort sur tous les citoyens de votre royaume y compris sur
moi bien sûr, si vous voulez me prendre par la force je ne peux pas résister. Mais si vous me
demandez mon avis, j'aime un homme c'est mon mari !
À ces paroles le roi reste comme pétrifié sur le lit où il était assis. Au bout d'un long moment de
silence, il se lève et rentre chez lui. Mais ce que ni le roi, ni Fatoumata ne savaient c'est que
Moussa était revenu, juste au moment où le roi entrait dans la cabane et qu'il a tout entendu.
Après le départ du roi, il passe le reste de la nuit dehors avec ses soucis.
Au petit matin, il entre dans la case et réveille sa femme et lui apprend que la guerre est finie.
Fatoumata, jubile, embrasse son mari de tous les côtés mais ce dernier reste silencieux et calme.
Elle s'inquiète, lui pose des questions sur sa santé, et tout, mais lui reste très calme. Au bout
d'un moment il dit à sa femme de rentrer chez ses parents jusqu'à ce qu'il y voie plus clair.
- Pourquoi, répond-elle, qu'est-ce que j'ai fait ?
Mais là aussi pas de réponse précise…
Fatoumata fait son sac et rentre chez ses parents. Une semaine se passe. Moussa ne va pas
donner d’explication aux parents de Fatoumata. Ils décident d'amener l'affaire chez le juge. En
ce temps là le roi était aussi le juge. Le roi reçoit les deux parties et donne d’abord la parole à
Fatoumata qui dit :
- Moi je n'ai rien compris, mon mari est parti au front, j’étais contente et pressée de le voir
rentrer, mais le jour où il est arrivé il m'a dit de partir chez mes parents.",French,Mauritanie,amine

Alors le roi juge se tourne vers Moussa, et lui demande :

- Alors, pourquoi lui as-tu dit de partir, demande le roi.
- C'est parce que j'ai peur.
- Peur de quoi, demandent le roi et ses notables qui l'entouraient.
- Une nuit, continue Moussa, j'ai vu les traces d'un lion dans ma maison. Comme je n’ai pas la
force de protéger ma femme, ni de me protéger, je lui ai demandé de partir chez ses parents.
Le roi reste longtemps silencieux, puis dit à Moussa :
- Est-ce que tu as remarqué des dégâts après le passage du lion ?
- Non, dit ce dernier.

L’autruche
Pays de collecte : Mauritanie.
Un conte dit en français et en wolof par Mamadou Sall.
De mémoire d'homme on n’a jamais vu d'autruche à Fondé, le village de Moussa. Un matin, un
animal géant, haut sur pattes qui ne ressemble pas à un oiseau parce qu'il est grand comme un
chameau, mais qui ne ressemble pas non plus à un mammifère parce qu'il a des plumes et qu'il a
seulement deux pattes. Cet animal bizarre entre dans le village, se dirige sur la place du marché
où sont déjà réunis, Moussa le vieux commerçant et plusieurs personnes.
En voyant la bête tous, vieux et jeunes, s’enfuient. L'animal seul sur la place se promène
tranquillement. Au bout d'un moment, un enfant qui était caché sous une peau de chameau non
loin de l'autruche, claque de ses deux mains pour lui faire peur, et là, on voit l'autruche qui
esquisse des pas de danse, l'enfant recommence et l'autruche se met à danser, aussitôt les
enfants puis les adultes se regroupent autour de lui en tapant des mains et l'autruche continue
de danser de plus belle.
La nouvelle se répand dans tous les villages et jusqu'aux confins de la forêt car en ce temps-là,
les animaux et les hommes parlaient le même langage. Aussitôt, le lion apprend la nouvelle,
justement cela coïncide avec la naissance de son fils, un beau petit lionceau. Le lion invite tout le
monde à une grande fête, l'autruche et tous les grands danseurs du pays.
À cette occasion le lion décide de faire des cadeaux et de donner beaucoup de privilèges au
meilleur danseur ainsi qu’à sa famille et à ses proches parents. Tout le monde répond à l'appel
et la fête commence. Chacun danse de son côté. Le roi lion s'installe au milieu de tout le monde
avec sa femme et le petit bébé bien installé dans sa couchette.
Bouki l’hyène qui ne savait pas danser mais qui voulait attirer les faveurs du lion, s'active en
faisant des va et vient entre la foule et la famille royale. Au bout d'un moment, l'autruche danse
si bien qu’elle attire l'attention de tout le public. Tous les animaux s’arrêtent de danser pour la
regarder et l'applaudir. C’est alors que Bouki s'approche du lion et lui chuchote au creux de
l'oreille :
- C’est ma nièce, c’est ma nièce !
L’autruche continue sa danse en sautant, virevoltant partout et dans son élan, elle piétine et
éventre le petit lionceau puis sans attendre s'envole dans les airs. Après avoir constaté le drame,
le lion dit à l'assemblée :
- Nous allons venger mon fils car si l'autruche s'est enfuie, son oncle est parmi nous.
Et il désigne Bouki l’hyène. Bouki, les larmes aux yeux, dit :
- Ce n'est pas possible, ce n’est pas possible, il n'y a aucun lien de parenté entre l'autruche qui
est un oiseau et le mammifère que je suis.

L’exil avorté
Pays de collecte : Mauritanie.
Un conte dit en français et en wolof par Mamadou Sall.
L’âne, le chien et le coq qui ont toujours vécu avec l’homme décident un jour de se séparer de
lui et d’aller vivre dans la forêt lointaine. En cours de route chacun dit ce qu’il reproche à
l’homme.
L’âne qui est choisi comme chef de groupe, commence :
- Moi, l’homme me fait travailler toute la journée, je laboure la terre, je lui transporte son eau,
ses bagages et quand le soir je rentre enfin à la maison il me donne un violent coup de bâton et
m’ordonne d’aller me chercher à manger alors que mon cousin le cheval est traité comme un
prince. L’homme lui apporte à manger, le lave et lui coupe les sabots même quand il monte sur
lui, il lui met une selle pour ne pas lui faire du mal. Cette situation je ne peux plus la supporter.
Le chien prend alors la parole :
- Moi je travaille toute la journée et toute la nuit. Le jour j’accompagne le berger pour garder le
troupeau et le soir je veille au moment où tout le monde dort et avec tout ça l’homme ne me
donne que ses restes à manger et s’il n’a pas de reste, je ne mange pas, alors que mon cousin le
chat, ne sort jamais de la maison, l’homme le traite comme son fils. Cet enfer je ne peux plus le
supporter.
Enfin le coq intervient :
- Moi tout le monde sait que c’est moi qui réveille l’homme le matin pour faire ses prières et
ensuite vaquer à ses occupations, mais quand il a de la visite il me tue. Quand il est à court
d’argent il me vend sur le marché. Cette précarité je ne peux moi non plus la supporter.
Après la parole du coq les trois amis arrivent au milieu de la forêt. Ils se construisent chacun une
case et s’y installent. Ils vivent ainsi tranquillement pendant de nombreuses années. Un jour
Bouki l’Hyène, passant à côté de leur case, remarque leur présence. Elle file avertir l’éléphant
leur chef. Ce dernier, pour vérifier les dires de Bouki, envoie Golo le singe.
En voyant le singe Golo arriver, le chien dit à ses amis :
- Laissez-le venir je m’en charge.
Il saute sur Golo et lui casse une patte. Celui-ci s’en retourne en traînant la patte. L’éléphant lui
dit :
- Toi tu es un vaurien et il envoie le charognard.
Lorsque l’âne aperçoit le charognard il dit à ses amis :
- Celui-ci, laissez-le moi, je lui règle son compte.
Et il se couche pour faire le mort. En le voyant dans cette position le charognard se précipite sur
lui et aussitôt les trois amis se jettent sur lui et lui administrent de violents coups de bâton. Le
charognard repart le corps couvert de sang.
- Vous êtes des vauriens, dit alors l’éléphant, c’est moi qui vais y aller.",French,Mauritanie,amine

ça accompagné de très forts cocoricos. Pris de peur, l’éléphant prend la fuite. En se sauvant il
piétine les cases des trois amis.
L’âne alors rassemble ses compagnons et leur dit :
- Ces gens ne nous laisseront plus jamais tranquille et nous ne savons pas où aller. Je vous
suggère d’appliquer l’adage qui dit que celui qui ne sait plus où il va doit retourner d’où il est
venu.

La fourmi et le roi Salomon
Pays de collecte : Mauritanie.
Un conte dit en français et en wolof par Mamadou Sall.
Lebon, un conte
Lipon, raconte.
Ce jour-là, une jeune fourmi avait osé, elle avait osé rester là, dans son trou, en train de
travailler, pendant que toutes les autres fourmis se bousculaient pour se prosterner sous les
pieds de Salomon, Salomon qui se promenait dans le désert, à côté de leur fourmilière. Salomon
était un roi doublé d'un prophète. Il avait des dons impressionnants dont celui de dompter les
animaux, de comprendre leur langage et de leur parler.
Malgré les ruades et bousculades de la foule, Salomon a remarqué l'absence de la jeune fourmi.
Il leva la tête, la découvrit dans son trou et lui dit :
- Que fais-tu là, bête menue, et pourquoi ne fais-tu pas comme tes congénères ?
- Sire, répondit-elle, ce n'est ni par impolitesse, ni par désobéissance que je ne suis pas venue
comme les autres, mais tout simplement, je m’occupe à quelque chose qui me tient
particulièrement à cœur : je veux déplacer cette dune de sable que vous voyez là !
- Ha ha ha ! Mon pauvre ami, rétorqua le roi Salomon, je doute que tu aies la vertu nécessaire,
c'est-à-dire la patience et surtout la chance suffisante, c'est-à-dire la longévité, pour accomplir
ce travail immense.
- Moi non plus je n'en sais rien, confessa la fourmi, mais ce que je sais c'est que la force qui me
pousse est plus puissante que la tempête du désert, je veux parler de la force de l'amour, car de
l'autre côté de la dune de sable se trouve ma bien-aimée. Si je mourais avant de l'atteindre, je
finirais ma vie dans la folie de cette chose qui meurt en dernier dans le cœur des êtres, c'est-à-
dire l'espérance.
Cet échange a fortement ébranlé le grand roi et prophète Salomon, qui, dans le désert au milieu
de nulle part, a compris le vrai sens de l'amour.

La ruse de Gayndé le lion
Pays de collecte : Mauritanie.
Un conte dit en français et en wolof par Mamadou Sall.
Trois bœufs vivaient ensemble, dans une forêt loin des autres animaux. Dans cet endroit, l’eau
et le pâturage étaient abondants. Les bœufs vivaient dans la joie et la bonne humeur, il leur
arrivait d'organiser des soirées de fête où ils dansaient et chantaient mazeyenkoum, ma
zeyenkoum, chacun disant aux deux autres : que vous êtes jolis, que vous êtes beaux. Seulement
les trois bœufs étaient de couleurs différentes, l'un était blanc, l'autre noir et le troisième lui,
était marron.
Un jour ils reçoivent la visite de Gayndé le lion qui leur propose de rester quelques jours avec
eux. Ils acceptent et continuent de vivre comme si de rien n'était. Lui, ce qu'il désire, c’est
manger les bœufs, mais comme ils sont tout le temps ensemble, il ne peut pas le faire.
Un soir, il vient à côté du bœuf blanc et du bœuf marron et leur dit en douce : « J'ai remarqué
une chose que vous n’avez pas vue. Ce bœuf noir, il est trop gourmand, tout le pâturage, toute
l'eau, si vous ne faites pas quelque chose il va les finir bientôt et vous allez tous mourir de faim.
Et j'ai même vu que dans l'enclos où vous dormez, il prend toute la place. Alors tuons-le avant
qu'il ne soit trop tard ». Les deux bœufs opposent un refus catégorique à la proposition du lion :
« Non, nous refusons, c’est notre frère ».
Le lendemain, le bœuf blanc et le bœuf marron commencent à prêter attention à la façon de
manger et de boire du bœuf noir. Quand ils s'arrêtent pour l'observer, lui continue à manger et
boire comme si de rien n'était. Une semaine passe, le lion comme la première fois vient voir le
bœuf blanc et le bœuf marron, et leur fait la même proposition. Encore une fois les deux bœufs
opposent un refus mais un refus moins catégorique : « Non, non, c'est notre frère ».
Les jours se succèdent et les deux bœufs prêtent de plus en plus attention au comportement du
bœuf noir. A la fin de la troisième semaine, après la fête du soir, les deux bœufs aident le lion à
tuer le bœuf noir. Le lion aussitôt mange le bœuf noir.
Un mois après, le lion s'approche discrètement du bœuf marron et lui dit : « Tu vois ce bœuf
blanc, il est différent de nous, toi comme moi nous sommes marron, mais lui il diffère de nous, il
est blanc, tuons-le et comme ça nous allons rester seuls dans la forêt avec notre belle couleur ».
Le bœuf marron n'ayant pas compris la ruse du lion, l'aide à tuer le bœuf blanc, que le lion
dévore sur le champ.
Quelques temps après comme le bœuf marron était tout seul dans la forêt avec le lion, ce
dernier n'a pas de peine pour le manger.

Le caïman et la pintade

Un conte dit en français et en wolof par Mamadou Sall.
Le caïman et la pintade entretenaient une amitié de longue date. C'était une amitié connue des
habitants des forêts et des eaux. Le caïman avait goûté à la viande de tous les oiseaux sauf à
celle de la pintade, parce qu'elle était son amie.
Mais un jour, il décide de faire fi de cette amitié et de manger la pintade. Très tôt le matin, il sort
de l'eau du fleuve avec ses enfants, et envoie l'un d'entre eux dire à la pintade qu'il est mort,
puis, il se couche sur le dos, ferme ses gros yeux entourés d'orbites en forme de pneu de
voiture, et ordonne à ses enfants restés à ses côtés de pleurer et de se lamenter. Le concert de
cris et de gémissements relayés par l'écho des falaises bordant le fleuve résonne de toutes
parts.
Un peu plus tard arrive la pintade accompagnée de ses enfants et du fils du caïman qui à son
tour se jette par terre et pleure comme ses frères. La pintade ordonne à ses enfants de se
mettre, comme elle, à une bonne distance du caïman et demande aux enfants du caïman de se
calmer pour lui permettre de dire une prière pour leur père. Les petits caïmans se taisent.
La pintade, après avoir versé quelques larmes de crocodile dit : « Caïman, si tu es vraiment mort,
remue le bout de ta queue ». Le bout de la queue du caïman, bouge d'abord timidement puis de
plus en plus fort. La pintade verse encore quelques larmes de crocodile et dit : « Caïman si tu es
réellement mort, et tout porte à croire que tu l'es, ouvre ton œil gauche ». Et l’œil gauche
s'ouvre. « Maintenant l'œil droit », reprend la pintade. Et l'œil droit s’ouvre. Aussitôt, la rusée
pintade s'envole avec ses enfants en disant : « Ce n'est pas aujourd’hui ni demain, ni jamais que
tu vas nous manger, vilaine bête ».

Il était une fois un chat qui avait faim. Il avait vraiment, vraiment, très très faim. Un jour qu'il
sortait pour avoir de quoi se mettre sous la dent, il découvre somnolant sur un rocher un petit
lézard couleur de sable. Sans réfléchir, il saute sur lui. Le petit lézard lui dit :
- Chat, toi tu es sot. Tu veux manger un lézard sans chair ni os, alors que si tu m’écoutes, je te
dirai comment tu peux faire pour avoir un gros poisson.
- Je n'ai pas le temps d'attendre, répond le chat et j'ai trop faim. Je vais te manger.
- Attends, insiste le petit lézard, attends et écoute-moi.
Alors le chat finit par l’écouter. Le petit lézard lui dit :
- Vois l'arbre qui est sur la rivière là devant. Mets-toi sur l'une de ses branches et attends. Une
mouche volera à côté de toi, tombera dans l’eau et aussitôt une grenouille sortira de l'eau pour
la manger.
- Mais tu te fous de moi ou quoi, tu m'avais parlé d'un gros poisson et maintenant…
- Attends, coupe le petit lézard, ton gros poisson arrive. Après la grenouille un petit poisson
sortira à son tour pour dévorer cette grenouille et c'est à ce moment précis que ton gros poisson
sortira pour manger le petit poisson. Comme tu es juste au-dessus sur la branche de l'arbre tu
n'auras qu’à tremper les pattes pour l'attraper !
Alors là le chat accepte la proposition du petit lézard mais avant de partir il prend soin de
boucher tous les trous qui étaient à côté du lézard, puis se tournant vers lui il lui dit : « Je vais
faire ce que tu as dit, mais si tu mens c'est toi que je dévorerai ». Puis il grimpe sur la branche de
l'arbre.
Aussitôt les choses se déroulent comme l'avait prévu le petit lézard. Lorsqu’arrive le tour du gros
poisson, le chat trempe ses pattes pour l'attraper mais le poisson est beaucoup plus fort que lui
et l'entraîne dans l'eau !!! Tout le monde sait que le chat aime le poisson mais déteste la nage. Il
se met à crier au secours en se noyant.
Le petit lézard était là observant toute la scène. Au moment où le chat se noie, il lui lance.
« Ô chat, toi aussi, tu finiras dans le ventre du gros poisson ».

Le chat pélerin
Pays de collecte : Mauritanie.
Un conte dit en français et en wolof par Mamadou Sall.
Un chat vivait à côté d'un village de souris, les temps étaient très durs ; il n’y avait rien à manger.
De peur d’être dévorées, les souris s'empressaient d'entrer dans leurs trous, à chaque fois
qu’elles voyaient le chat. Celui-ci maigrissait à vue d’œil.
Un matin très tôt, le chat sort de chez lui, marche dans les rues désertes en criant à haute voix
pour se faire entendre :
- Écoutez-moi, je ne dis que la vérité, demain je vais faire un pèlerinage à la Mecque, comme ça
je ne ferai plus de mal à autrui.
Après avoir arpenté toutes les rues vides, il part au pèlerinage. Le temps fait ce qu'il a toujours
l'habitude de faire, c'est-à-dire qu’il passe et un jour, le chat revient de son pèlerinage.
Il est vêtu tout de blanc. Il porte un large boubou blanc, et est coiffé d’un turban blanc. Il tient
dans sa main gauche un long chapelet en perle, il a laissé pousser une longue barbe, il marche
lentement en s’appuyant sur un bâton qu'il tient dans sa main droite.
Dès le lendemain de son retour, il convoque à la mosquée, toutes les souris afin qu’elles
écoutent une causerie religieuse. Les souris rassurées par son changement répondent toutes à
l’appel. Elles entrent toutes dans la mosquée, toutes, sauf une, la plus vieille d'entre elles. Cette
dernière, choisit un coin derrière la porte en disant que c'était la meilleure place pour écouter le
discours du chat.
Le chat pèlerin accompagné d'un autre chat, le chat sentinelle, s’installe devant l’assemblée.
Après les salutations d’usage, le chat pèlerin chuchote quelques mots dans le creux de l’oreille
du chat sentinelle qui ferme la porte. En un clin d’œil, les deux chats se jettent dans la foule des
souris et les dévorent toute sauf, bien sûr, la vieille souris qui détale en disant haut et fort :
- Un ennemi ne devient jamais un ami.

Le chien et ses compagnons
Pays de collecte : Mauritanie.
Un conte dit en français et en wolof par Mamadou Sall.
L'ancêtre du chien avait manifesté à l’homme, son maître, une grande fidélité. Il lui gardait sa
maison, son troupeau, il l'accompagnait partout et ne lui coûtait presque rien, car pour sa
nourriture, le chien se contentait des restes de son maître. L’homme l'aimait beaucoup et l'avait
pris comme son compagnon de tous les jours. Toute leur vie, ils avaient vécu ensemble sans
aucun problème.
Dieu fut tellement ému et content de cette amitié que le jour de leur mort, car ils étaient morts
le même jour, Il décida de leur donner la plus grande des récompenses : le Paradis.
L'homme et son chien, très contents, prennent donc la direction du Paradis ; l’homme devant, le
chien derrière. Quand ils arrivent à la porte, l'homme entre, avance un moment puis se retourne
pour regarder son chien. Il le voit debout devant la porte, la tête dedans et le reste du corps
dehors. Il l'appelle lui demandant de se dépêcher pour entrer, le chien répond :
- Il me suffit de respirer l'odeur du paradis.
Et il se dépêche de rebrousser chemin.
Sur sa route, le chien rencontre l’âne et la chèvre, ils décident de manger ensemble. En chemin,
ils voient une voiture, ils l’arrêtent et le chauffeur leur dit que le billet est de 100 Ouguiyas, mais
puisqu'ils sont trois il leur fait une réduction, ce sera 80 ouguiyas chacun. L'âne sort 80 ouguiyas,
les remet au chauffeur; le chien, n'avait pas la monnaie et donne 100 ouguiyas; la chèvre qui
n’avait pas d'argent dit :
- Moi je fais ""arrivée payée"".
Parfois chez nous si quelqu'un n'a pas d’argent il peut prendre une voiture et quand il arrive la
famille paie.
Ils entrent dans la voiture, le chauffeur démarre.
Arrivée à la porte du village, ils descendent tous. Mais la chèvre aussitôt les pattes par terre,
s’enfuit et disparaît dans la nature. Le chauffeur la voyant détaler, démarre sa voiture pour
l'attraper. Le chien qui attendait sa monnaie, quand il vit la voiture partir, se mit lui aussi à courir
pour l'arrêter. L'âne lui, ayant payé, s'en va tranquillement.
Depuis, chez nous, quand une chèvre entend le bruit d'un moteur, elle fuit pour ne pas payer
son billet ; l’âne lui, il faut l'éviter sur la route car il a déjà payé son billet ; quant au chien, il
poursuit toujours les voitures pour réclamer sa monnaie sans jamais avoir soif car le fait de
respirer l'odeur du Paradis fait qu'il a toujours le museau humide.

Le crâne
Pays de collecte : Mauritanie.
Un conte dit en français et en wolof par Mamadou Sall.
Le désert avait, cette année-là, changé de visage, la couleur jaune ocre des dunes avait laissé la
place au joli vert d’un tapis végétal abondant. Les lits des oueds étaient pleins d'eau et ça et là,
on apercevait des flaques d'eau dans le creux des dunes.
C'était une année de rêve pour Ahmed, le berger nomade, et pour tous les habitants du désert.
Ahmed n'avait plus besoin de suivre à longueur de journée son troupeau de chameaux à la
recherche de pâturage ; l'herbe était partout. Ahmed était déchargé du travail, il pouvait rester
tranquillement sous sa tente, siroter son thé à la menthe ou se promener sur les dunes.
Une après-midi, Ahmed sort de sa tente, il marche un long moment sur la crête des dunes et
soudain, il se pose sur le sommet d'une dune et fixe l'horizon au loin. Sans se départir de sa
contemplation, il regarde en dessous de lui dans le creux de la dune, et là, il voit une flaque
d'eau, dans laquelle flotte quelque chose de blanc. Intrigué, il descend de la dune, s'en approche
et s’aperçoit qu’il s’agit d’un crâne humain.
- Un crâne humain qui est-ce qui a pu amener ce crâne-la ici ? À ce que je sache il n'y a pas de
cimetière dans les parages.
À sa grande surprise il entend le crâne lui dire :
- Eh homme, moi, c'est la parole qui m'a amené ici !
- Un crâne humain qui parle, s'exclame-t-il de nouveau, cette nouvelle il faut que je l'apporte au
roi.
Il prend ses jambes à son cou et s'en va directement au palais. Il y arrive et s'écrie au roi,
- J’ai vu de mes yeux, ai entendu de mes oreilles une chose extraordinaire, j'ai vu un crâne
humain qui parlait !
- Tu me prends pour un fou ou pour un imbécile ?
- Je ne dis que la vérité sir.
- Si tu dis la vérité, reprend le roi tu seras récompensé, mais attention si tu mens, je te ferais
couper la tête.
- Je dis vrai, Sir, je dis vrai. Le roi et tous les gens du royaume accompagnent Ahmed, pour
découvrir la nouvelle. Aussitôt arrivé sur les lieux Ahmed se précipite sur le crâne :
- Crâne, voici le roi et tous ces gens qui sont là pour t’entendre, parle leur comme tu m'as parlé
tout à l’heure !
Le crâne reste silencieux.
- Parle insiste Ahmed, vas-y parle leur ! Le crâne reste muet.
Comme promis, le roi ordonne à un de ses bourreaux de lui trancher la tête.
Ce dernier l'amène jusqu'au sommet de la dune et slash il lui coupe la tête.
Sa tête roule et vient cogner le crâne qui était dans l'eau. Alors, le crâne lui demande :
- Oh tête qui t'a mené ici,
Et la tête de dire :
- La parole.

Le diable et la beauté
Pays de collecte : Mauritanie.
Un conte dit en français et en wolof par Mamadou Sall.
Le diable vivait dans son palais, sous la terre ! Son palais était confortable et la nourriture y était
abondante. Mais le diable était seul et au bout de quelques années, il commença à s’ennuyer.
Un matin, il décide donc de remonter sur la surface de la terre.
En arrivant, il lève la tête, il voit au loin des jeunes filles qui jouent, il s'en approche et remarque
l’une d’elle qui était d'une rare beauté. Il lui dit :
- Belle jeune fille, si tu acceptes de m'épouser et de me suivre dans mon beau palais sous la
terre, je te donnerai toutes les parures et tous les joyaux de la terre !
- Toutes les parures et les joyaux de la terre ? Mais que pourrais-je en faire, cela ne m'intéresse
pas du tout.
Le diable, sentant qu'il n'avait aucune chance d'amener avec lui cette belle jeune fille, se jette
sur elle et d'un geste violent et sec lui arrache sa beauté ! Il arrive dans son palais, jette la
beauté de la fille sur les murs qui se mettent à étinceler de beauté !
De longues années plus tard, le diable, toujours seul dans son palais s'ennuie toujours ! Il décide
de revenir sur la surface de la terre et d'aller voir ce que la belle ancienne jeune fille était
devenue. Il se renseigne au village, on lui apprend qu'elle vit dans une cabane au fond de la
forêt. Il s'y rend donc. Il trouve la cabane et en regardant à travers les fenêtres, il voit une vielle
femme très ordinaire assise à côté d'un vieil homme tout aussi ordinaire.
La porte de la cabane étant entrouverte, le diable y entre furtivement. Et il sent monter entre
les deux vieilles personnes une telle force d'amour qu'il en perd la vue et surtout le sens de
l'orientation à tel point qu’il ne parvient plus à retrouver le chemin qui le ramènera dans son
beau palais.
Depuis ce jour-là, le diable court toujours.

Le fou du village
Pays de collecte : Mauritanie.
Un conte dit en français et en wolof par Mamadou Sall.
Autrefois dans nos villages les enfants, garçons comme filles, appartenaient à des « m’bawars » ; ce
sont des groupements organisés basés sur des tranches d’âges. Ceux qui avaient la même tranche
d’âge, appartenaient au même « m’bawars ». Au sein du « m’bawars » s’organisaient toutes sortes
d’activités (culturelles, sportives, sociales…). Que l’enfant soit bien portant, handicapé physique ou
mental, il avait son « m’bawars ». Moussa Diakhaté était un malade mental, il avait son « m’bawars ».
Un jour Moussa et son « m’bawars » organisent une sortie dans la forêt voisine. Au milieu de la forêt,
ils voient deux taureaux gras et gros qui ruminent tranquillement sous un acacia. Ils attrapent les
taureaux et les tuent, se partagent la viande en excluant Moussa le fou du partage.
Moussa ne dit rien, mais le lendemain il retourne tout seul dans la forêt. En cours de route il rencontre
deux bergers. Après les salutations, les bergers lui demandent son nom, Moussa dit qu’il n’en a pas et
demande aux bergers s’ils cherchent deux taureaux.
- Oui, répondent ces derniers.
- Ils sont deux n’est-ce pas, enchaîne Moussa, l’un est de couleur blanche avec de longues cornes,
l’autre est de couleur rougeâtre avec de petites cornes.
- C’est exactement cela, exultent les bergers.
- Où sont-ils ?
- Je ne les ai pas vu, dit Moussa.
- Ce n’est pas possible disent les autres. De toute façon on ne te laissera pas tant que tu ne nous auras
pas montré nos taureaux car d’après les indications que tu nous as données tu as bien vu nos
taureaux. Après quelques moments de palabres, Moussa leur dit : « Suivez-moi, je vais vous montrer
vos taureaux. »
Arrivés au village, ils trouvent ses amis du « m’bawars » en train de boire le thé sous un arbre et
Moussa dit alors aux bergers :
- Ces gens que vous voyez là, ce sont vos voleurs.
Aussitôt des discussions éclatent, les bergers réclament avec force leurs taureaux, les autres nient en
prétendant que ce sont les paroles d’un fou. Après plusieurs heures de conciliabules, les bergers s’en
vont appeler la police.
Moussa Diakhaté se tourne vers ses amis et leur dit :
- Donnez-moi ma part de viande et j’arrange les choses.
Pris de peur, ils envoient un des leurs dans différentes maisons pour récupérer ici un morceau de
viande, là un morceau d’os, là-bas un bout d’intestin et les apporte chez Moussa.
Quelques moments plus tard les bergers reviennent accompagnés par de nombreux policiers.
Moussa les accueillent et leur dit :
- Écoutez les taureaux sont bien rentrés dans le village, ils ont trouvé ces gens en train de prier ; ils leur
ont donné des coups de tête, ils ont piétiné les livres de Coran qui étaient posés par terre, ils ont cassé
les murs de la mosquée et enfin ils sont retournés jusqu’à cet endroit-là, et ils sont tous les deux
entrés dans ce trou de lézard.
Dépités les policiers reprennent leur voiture et l’assemblée se disperse.

Le garçon et les œufs
Pays de collecte : Mauritanie.
Un conte dit en français et en wolof par Mamadou Sall.
Il y a longtemps dans un petit village vivait un garçon qui aimait les œufs plus que toute autre
chose. A chaque fois qu’il voyait un œuf, sa première réaction était de le mettre dans sa poche
et de le manger après. Pour ce faire, il portait toujours des pantalons très larges avec de grandes
poches.
Ce garçon était amoureux d’une fille qui vivait dans un village non loin du sien. Un jour il décide
d’aller lui rendre visite. À son arrivée la fille qui l’aimait aussi, invite ses copines autour d’un thé.
Les copines s’installent, l’ambiance monte, tout le monde chante et danse.
Tout à coup, une poule sort de la case dont la porte fait face à l’endroit où est assis le garçon et
là il se dit, « si cette poule sort à cette heure c’est qu’elle doit pondre des œufs. » Il appelle sa
fiancée et lui demande de lui indiquer les toilettes. Après indications, il sort mais prend soin de
jeter un coup d’œil dans la case d’où est sortie la poule. Il y voit effectivement beaucoup d’œufs.
Discrètement, il entre, en remplit ses poches et revient jusqu’au seuil de la porte où était les
filles.
Il dit à sa fiancée :
- Excuse-moi, je suis désolé, mais je dois partir. J’ai beaucoup de choses à faire au village.
Sa fiancée veut le retenir mais il persiste. La fille lui propose de l’accompagner avec ses copines
jusqu’au coin de la rue comme il est de coutume.
Malheureusement pour lui une de ses poches est trouée et après quelques mètres, poutte ! Un
œuf tombe. Il regarde les filles qui se regardent entre elles et personne ne dit rien.
Silence.
Il continue quelques pas et poutte ! Un deuxième œuf tombe. Il regarde les filles qui se
regardent et là aussi silence !
Quelques pas encore en avant et poutte ! Un troisième œuf tombe. Il s’arrête et dit aux filles :
- Est-ce que chez vous aussi les garçons pondent des œufs ?
- Non répondent-elles ici ce sont les poules qui pondent des œufs.
- Comme les hommes sont différents, dit le garçon, voyez-vous chez nous ce sont les garçons qui
pondent surtout quand ils sont entourés par des filles.

Le jeune homme et le lion
Pays de collecte : Mauritanie.
Un conte dit en français et en wolof par Mamadou Sall.
Il était une fois un jeune citadin qui n’avait jamais quitté sa ville et qui décide un jour de visiter le
village de ses ancêtres, un petit village perdu dans la campagne, situé près d’une grande forêt.
Dans cette forêt, il y avait beaucoup d’animaux sauvages et surtout des lions. Le jeune homme
n’avait jamais vu de lion ni à la télévision, ni en photos. Il faut dire que ces produits de la
modernité n’étaient pas connus dans ces temps-là chez nous.
Les gens de ce village n’allaient jamais dans la forêt, à cause des lions. On raconte même que,
quand les lions rugissaient dans la forêt, les portes des maisons claquaient, les canaris et les
marmites se renversaient et tous les gens se terraient dans leur maison.
Un beau matin, donc, le jeune citadin qui s’appelait Demba débarque dans le village de ses
ancêtres, et fait vite connaissance avec tout le monde, et surtout avec Fatou, une belle jeune
fille qui était une de ses cousines lointaines. Les fiançailles ne durent pas longtemps, ils décident
de se marier. Après quelques jours de noces, Demba retourne en ville.
Une année plus tard, il décide de retourner au village pour s’y installer définitivement avec
Fatou et leur enfant. Pour marquer sa venue et montrer sa bravoure, il propose à sa femme une
promenade dans la forêt. Cette dernière, surprise, lui dit :
- Mais tu es fou, tu veux que les lions nous dévorent tous les deux.
- Tu vas voir que moi je suis un homme, je ne suis pas comme les poltrons de chez vous. Suis moi
et amène avec toi notre fils, dit Demba.
La mort dans l’âme, Fatou obéit à son époux.
Arrivés à l’orée de la forêt soudain un chacal sort d’une touffe d’herbes et file devant eux.
Demba se met à crier :
- Ah, ah tu vois, les lions, quand ils me voient, ils détalent.
- Mais ce n’est pas un lion, dit Fatou.
- C’est quoi ? demande Demba.
- C’est un chacal, répond Fatou.
- Qu’importe, dit Demba, tu vas voir !
Quelques moments après, c’est au tour d’une hyène de détaler devant eux. Demba saute et dit :
- Ce n’est pas un chacal, c’est un lion, il est plus grand !
- Doucement, dit Fatou, ce n’est qu’une hyène.
Après avoir longuement marché sans voir de lion, Demba propose à sa femme de se reposer à
l’ombre d’un acacia. Fatou aménage de la place sur le sol pour son enfant qui commence à
dormir. Elle se couche derrière l’enfant, Demba fatigué fait de même. La brise et la fraîcheur de
l'ombre aidant, ils s’endorment tous.
Pendant ce temps, un lion arrive et s’installe sous un arbre à quelques pas d’eux. Le bébé se
réveille le premier. Il voit l’animal et à quatre pattes s’approche de lui, et commence à jouer
avec sa queue. Fatou à son tour se réveille et aperçoit son enfant en train de jouer avec le lion !",French,Mauritanie,amine

Elle réveille son mari et lui dit :
- Notre enfant est en danger, il joue avec le lion. Demba se redresse, fixe l’animal et dit :
- C’est ça un lion ?
- C’est ça même, répond Fatou.
Aussitôt Demba commence à retrousser le bas de son pantalon. Fatou lui demande alors :
- Tu vas sauter sur lui ? Demba fait non de la tête et retrousse les manches de sa chemise.
- Tu vas le frapper avec un bâton ? demande à nouveau Fatou.
Il fait non de la tête et dit à Fatou :
- Donne moi la main.
- Tu vas fuir ? questionne Fatou.
- Oui, s’il plait à Dieu, répond Demba.
- Et notre fils ? dit Fatou en pleurant.
- On en fera un autre, crie Demba qui a déjà commencé à courir.
Mais heureusement pour le bébé, ce n’était pas un lion mais une lionne, qui lui avait même
donné un peu de son lait.

Le lièvre, le chameau et l’hippopotame
Pays de collecte : Mauritanie.
Un conte dit en français et en wolof par Mamadou Sall.
Un lièvre voulait cultiver son champ de mil, mais n'ayant pas la force physique nécessaire pour
labourer, semer et sarcler, il décida de se servir des autres.
Il alla voir le chameau dans le désert et lui proposa une association.
- D’accord, répond le chameau, mais comment vont se dérouler les travaux et le partage du fruit
du travail ?
- Les choses se feront ainsi, continue le lièvre, il s'agit d'un terrain qui m'appartient, je l’ai hérité
de mon père qui l'a hérité du sien, c'est donc mon champ ; toi tu travailleras la journée et moi la
nuit, quand la récolte arrivera on se partagera le fruit de la récolte en deux parts égales.
- Je suis d'accord, dit le chameau.
Le soir, le lièvre descend au bord du fleuve et fait la même proposition à l’hippopotame. Comme
l’hippopotame ne sort de l’eau que la nuit, cette fois-ci il lui propose de travailler la nuit.
- Marché conclut, dit l’hippopotame.
Les jours succèdent aux jours, les nuits aux nuits, et les deux géants travaillent dur. Quand le
chameau arrive le jour, il dit : « Eh bien, ce lièvre est vraiment brave ». L'hippopotame, la nuit,
fait la même remarque.
Le lièvre passe de temps en temps pour voir l'avancement des travaux. Ainsi les deux géants ont
labouré, semé et sarclé le champ. Un matin le lièvre passe et constate que les épis de mil sont
bien mûrs. Il va donc voir tour à tour le chameau et l'hippopotame et leur fixe une même date
pour la récolte. Une semaine avant le jour fixé, le lièvre, accompagné de sa femme et de ses
enfants, travaille à récolter tout le champ. Au jour convenu de la récolte, le chameau et sa
famille, l'hippopotame et la sienne se rencontrent dans le champ déjà complètement récolté.
Après explication ils jurent tous de tuer le lièvre.
Depuis ce jour, le lièvre ne reste pas un moment sans se retourner à gauche et à droite car il
pense toujours être poursuivi.

Le pari du singe et du lièvre

Un conte dit en français et en wolof par Mamadou Sall.
Tout le monde sait que le singe ne peut pas rester un moment sans se gratter le corps. Tout le
monde sait aussi que le lièvre, curieux qu'il est comme un journaliste, ne peut pas rester un
moment sans se retourner à gauche et à droite pour voir ce qui se passe aux alentours.
Un matin, les deux compères se rencontrent, dans la forêt, sous un acacia. Le lièvre dit au singe :
- Est-ce que tu sais ce que les gens disent de toi ? Eh bien, ils disent que tu ne peux pas rester un
seul instant sans te gratter le corps. Il y en a même qui disent que ta mère t’a enfanté dans une
fourmilière et depuis les fourmis sont dans ta chaire ce qui explique ça.
- C'est faux, répond le singe, moi je peux rester une heure, deux heures, vingt-quatre heures
même sans me gratter le corps. Ils racontent n'importe quoi. Toi aussi avec tes longues oreilles
qui semblent défier le ciel, est-ce que tu as entendu ce que les gens disent de toi, ha ha ha, ils
disent que tu ne peux pas rester un seul instant sans te retourner à gauche, à droite et regarder
en bas et en haut.
- C'est archi-faux, dit le lièvre, je peux rester une heure, deux heures, vingt quatre heures même
sans me retourner.
- Alors faisons un pari pour vérifier ça, dit le singe.
- D’accord, répond l'autre.
- Mettons-nous l'un en face de l'autre, dit le lièvre, pour voir qui de nous deux restera le plus
longtemps, toi sans te gratter ou moi sans me retourner.
Ils se mettent face à face et l'épreuve commence.
Au bout d'une bonne heure de concentration, pendant laquelle aucun n'a ni bougé, ni parlé, le
lièvre dit :
- Si on se racontait des histoires pour meubler le temps.
- D’accord fait l’autre, vas-y, commence.
Le lièvre dit :
- Tu sais il y a longtemps, j’ai participé à une guerre ! Si tu savais comment les balles fusaient.
Elles nous venaient de tous les côtés, du côté droit, il se tourne vers le côté droit, les balles nous
venaient du côté gauche, il se tourne vers le côté gauche. Le singe lui coupe alors la parole, en
disant :
- Mais ça ce n'est rien du tout, moi j'ai participé à une guerre bien plus meurtrière encore où les
balles nous tapaient sur la poitrine, et il se gratte la poitrine, des balles continue-t-il nous
tapaient sur la cuisse gauche et il se gratte la cuisse gauche.
Brusquement le lièvre se met à sauter en criant :
- J’ai gagné, j'ai gagné, tu t'es gratté.
Et l’autre lui répond :
- Mais toi tu t'es retourné avant moi.
Depuis ce jour, quand il y a un pari manqué ; on dit que c'est le pari du lièvre et du singe.

La vie devenait de plus en plus dure dans le pays des singes : les golos. Depuis longtemps, il
n'avait pas plu, et il n’y avait plus d'épis de mil ou de maïs à voler dans les champs ; les melons
et pastèques ne poussaient plus, même les racines de nénuphar avaient disparu du lit séché des
marigots. C'était la sécheresse, c’était la famine.
Le chef réunit le peuple pour trouver une solution et sortir de cette crise. Il promet d'aller lui-
même repérer un autre pays où son peuple pourra trouver à manger et à boire.
Le lendemain avant le lever du jour, il se met en route. Il marche un jour, il marche une semaine.
Au bout d'un mois, il arrive dans un endroit qui ressemble à un coin de paradis. L'eau coule à flot
; les arbres fruitiers sont nombreux, on voit des champs de mil et de maïs, des pastèques à perte
de vue. Le chef mange d'abord à sa faim, puis se pose sur la branche d'un arbre pour mieux
observer ce lieu magique. Avant de repartir, il voit une scène qui l'inquiète, mais il se dépêche
pour annoncer la bonne nouvelle à son peuple.
Dès son retour il leur dit :
- J'ai trouvé un endroit où la nourriture et l'eau sont abondantes, un endroit agréable, mais j'ai
vu là-bas une scène inquiétante.
- Quelle est cette scène demandent les autres en chœur ?
- L'endroit n'est pas loin d'un village de paysans, et j'ai vu une fille qui pilait le mil avec un pilon
et un mortier. Autour d'elle sautillaient des chèvres et des brebis. Le fils du chef de ce village
jouait avec ces bêtes. Les bêtes voulaient manger le mil alors la fille s’est mise à les chasser avec
son pilon !
- Mais qu'est-ce que cela a à voir avec nous ? disent les autres. Ce qui nous importe c'est d'avoir
à manger et à boire c'est tout. On y part dès demain.
Ils arrivent sur les lieux, s'y installent et vivent bien, pendant plusieurs mois.
Un jour, la fille, en chassant une chèvre avec son pilon, la loupe et casse la tête du fils du chef du
village. Le chef, son père, réunit tous les guérisseurs pour le sauver. Ils exigent une grosse
quantité de cervelle de singe pour le guérir. Alors en quelques heures, les garçons du village
attrapent tous les singes et les attachent aux arbres, les pieds et les fesses en l'air et la tête qui
pend en bas.
Les singes se tournent alors vers leur chef pour lui demander un conseil. Ce dernier leur dit :
- Vous ne m'avez pas écouté quand j'avais la tête en haut, sur mes épaules, que dire maintenant
que j'ai la tête en bas et les fesses en l'air ?

Pourquoi Bouki l’hyène a peur du chameau…
Pays de collecte : Mauritanie.
Un conte dit en français et en wolof par Mamadou Sall.
Cette année-là, il y avait une famine terrible dans le pays des animaux et la plupart mourraient de
faim. Bouki, l’hyène, vivotait avec sa petite famille, sa femme et ses deux enfants. Un jour que Bouki
marchait dans la forêt sans savoir où aller pour trouver quelque chose à se mettre sous la dent, Bouki
voit un animal haut sur pattes, le cou long, les yeux enfoncés dans leur orbite et le dos en forme de
dune de sable.
Bouki s'approche de lui et lui dit :
- Que tu es grand et fort, comment t'appelles-tu ?
- Je m'appelle : chameau.
- Ah bon, dit Bouki, tu dois être très fort et très méchant et surtout un grand lutteur…
- Oh non, je ne suis pas méchant répond l'autre, juste un peu fort, quand à la lutte ce n'est pas mon
point fort.
- Crois-tu que quinze hyènes comme moi et moi-même pouvons te terrasser ?
- Oh c’est trop pour moi dit le chameau.
- Et 10 comme moi et moi-même ?
- C'est encore trop.
- Alors 5 comme moi et moi-même ?
- C'est trop pour moi.
- 2 et moi ?
- Non toujours trop.
- Alors prépare-toi j'arrive !
Bouki se jette sur le ventre du chameau, avec ses longues dents et ses griffes, il le déchire ! Bouki
mange d'abord à sa faim puis emporte le reste chez lui. Une semaine durant la famille mange à sa
faim. A la fin de la semaine la viande est finie. Bouki s’en va dans la forêt pour chercher un autre
chameau.
Après quelques heures de marche, Bouki aperçoit un énorme animal haut sur pattes, les yeux
enfoncés dans les orbites, le dos en forme de dune mais qui a devant une longue trompe. Bouki
court à toute vitesse vers lui en disant :
- Oh chameau ! Arrête, arrête, on va lutter !
L'autre s’arrête et lui dit :
- Je ne suis pas chameau, je suis un éléphant.
- Quoi tu crois que tu peux me tromper ? J'ai terrassé l'autre jour un de tes congénères.
Sans attendre Bouki se jette sur l'éléphant. Ce dernier l'enroule dans sa trompe, l'envoie en l'air, le
laisse atterrir violemment par terre, puis l'écrase avec ses grosses pattes un long moment avant de
continuer son chemin, pensant que Bouki était morte.
Bouki est restée là trois jours et trois nuits. Au matin du quatrième jour, Bouki reprend ses esprits,
ouvre les yeux et voit sa famille qui était autour d'elle, dans un dernier souffle Bouki leur dit :
- Il ne faut plus jamais s'attaquer aux chameaux.
Depuis ce jour les hyènes ne s'approchent plus des chameaux.

Pourquoi l’éléphant a peur du coq ?
Pays de collecte : Mauritanie.
Un conte dit en français et en wolof par Mamadou Sall.
Autrefois, pendant la saison froide chez nous, les animaux, comme les hommes coupaient du bois
pour se réchauffer. Cette année-là il faisait vraiment froid. Il faisait tellement froid que les oiseaux
n'arrivaient même plus à voler. Tellement froid que les animaux arrivaient difficilement à sortir de
leurs cases et leurs pattes restaient collées au sol une bonne partie de la journée.
Un matin Golo le singe vient voir Samba le forgeron et lui dit :
- Samba vite fais-moi une hache, je n'en peux plus, il fait froid.
Samba aussitôt commence le travail.
Quelque temps après arrive Bouki l’hyène qui dit en nasillant :
- Samba, vite fais-moi une hache.
- Je veux bien, répond Samba mais il y un problème.
- Lequel ?
- Il y a que Golo le singe vient juste de m'en commander une et il semble très pressé.
- Écoute dit Bouki, s'il revient dis-lui que c'est moi, Bouki l’hyène, qui veux la hache d’abord.
Quand Golo le singe revient pour voir l'avancement des travaux, Samba lui fait savoir le message de
Bouki.
- Bon dit-il dans ce cas, fais-la lui.
Et Golo s’empresse de détaler.
Arrive alors Gayndé le lion qui, à son tour, commande une hache.
- Je veux bien, lui dit Samba, mais je travaille à une hache pour Bouki l’hyène.
- Écoute, dit Gayndé, si Bouki revient ici, dis-lui que c'est moi Gayndé le roi lion qui veux la hache en
premier.
Quelques temps après, Bouki arrive pour récupérer sa hache.
- Attention, lui dit Samba le forgeron, après ton départ, Gayndé est venu et il a commandé la hache.
- Dans ce cas fais-la lui, dit Bouki en détalant.
Quelques minutes après, Samba voit venir Niaye l’éléphant.
- Samba vite, vite, fais-moi une hache.
- Je veux bien, répond Samba, mais Gayndé le lion vient juste de commander cette hache que je fais.
- Quoi ? dit Niaye l'éléphant, s'il revient, dis-lui que c'est moi Niaye qui veux cette hache.
Au retour de Gayndé, Samba lui apprend le message de Niaye l'éléphant.
Aussitôt le lion détale.
Quand Samba lève sa tête pour regarder Gayndé courir, il voit venir Ganard le coq qui, à son tour,
commande la hache.
- Ce n'est pas possible dit Samba, Niaye l'éléphant l'a déjà commandée.
- Mais c'est moi Ganard le coq qui veut cette hache.
Quand Niaye revient Samba lui apprend que Ganard veut la hache. Alors Niaye l’éléphant écarte ses
pattes et dépose un gros tas de crotte sur le sol. Un tas aussi gros que la case du forgeron. Puis il dit à
Samba :
- Si Ganard revient dis-lui que c'est celui qui a déposé ça qui aura la hache.",French,Mauritanie,amine

Quelques temps après, Ganard le coq accompagné par de nombreuses poules, revient. En voyant le
tas de crotte il se jette dessus, le disperse et le mange. Quand il n'en reste rien, il enlève une de ses
plumes et la plante au milieu de l'endroit où était le gros tas. Il s’adresse alors à Samba et lui dit :
- Si Niaye vient dis-lui qu'il m’a suffit d'un petit souffle pour disperser son tas et ce qui est planté là
n’est qu'un des poils d'une mes narines.
Quand Niaye l'éléphant, à son retour, voit ce qui s'est passé et entend le message de Ganard le coq, il
prend peur et va vite se réfugier dans la forêt.
Depuis ce jour l'éléphant vit au fond de la forêt et ne s'approche plus des villages.

Il était une fois un chat qui avait faim. Il avait vraiment, vraiment, très très faim. Un jour qu'il sortait
pour avoir de quoi se mettre sous la dent, il découvre somnolant sur un rocher un petit lézard
couleur de sable. Sans réfléchir, il saute sur lui. Le petit lézard lui dit :
- Chat, toi tu es sot. Tu veux manger un lézard sans chair ni os, alors que si tu m’écoutes, je te dirai
comment tu peux faire pour avoir un gros poisson.
- Je n'ai pas le temps d'attendre, répond le chat et j'ai trop faim. Je vais te manger.
- Attends, insiste le petit lézard, attends et écoute-moi.
Alors le chat finit par l’écouter. Le petit lézard lui dit :
- Vois l'arbre qui est sur la rivière là devant. Mets-toi sur l'une de ses branches et attends. Une
mouche volera à côté de toi, tombera dans l’eau et aussitôt une grenouille sortira de l'eau pour la
manger.
- Mais tu te fous de moi ou quoi, tu m'avais parlé d'un gros poisson et maintenant…
- Attends, coupe le petit lézard, ton gros poisson arrive. Après la grenouille un petit poisson sortira à
son tour pour dévorer cette grenouille et c'est à ce moment précis que ton gros poisson sortira pour
manger le petit poisson. Comme tu es juste au-dessus sur la branche de l'arbre tu n'auras qu’à
tremper les pattes pour l'attraper !
Alors là le chat accepte la proposition du petit lézard mais avant de partir il prend soin de boucher
tous les trous qui étaient à côté du lézard, puis se tournant vers lui il lui dit : « Je vais faire ce que tu
as dit, mais si tu mens c'est toi que je dévorerai ». Puis il grimpe sur la branche de l'arbre.
Aussitôt les choses se déroulent comme l'avait prévu le petit lézard. Lorsqu’arrive le tour du gros
poisson, le chat trempe ses pattes pour l'attraper mais le poisson est beaucoup plus fort que lui et
l'entraîne dans l'eau !!! Tout le monde sait que le chat aime le poisson mais déteste la nage. Il se met
à crier au secours en se noyant.
Le petit lézard était là observant toute la scène. Au moment où le chat se noie, il lui lance.
« Ô chat, toi aussi, tu finiras dans le ventre du gros poisson ».

Boori ou la vache perdue
Pays de collecte : Sénégal.
Un conte dit en français par Massamba Guèye et en sérère par Raphaël Ndiaye.
Un enfant était parti faire paître le troupeau de son père. Il perdit une vache du nom de Boori.
Son père lui dit : « Tu ne mangeras et ne boiras que lorsque tu m'auras ramené Boori. » L'enfant
se mit à marcher, à marcher.
Lorsqu'il arriva dans un village il chanta :
« 0 Boori, ô Boori
Boori la brave
Si calme qu'était le troupeau
Boori était en éveil
Dans le troupeau de Mbaamaan ô Boori ».
- Boori n'est-elle pas passée par ici ?
(On lui dit :)
- Ey ! Boori est passée ici il y a 30 hivernages, un Peul la conduisait.
Il se remit à courir ; arrivé dans un autre village, il chanta à nouveau :
« 0 Boori, ô Boori
Boori la brave
Si calme qu'était le troupeau
Boori était en éveil
Dans le troupeau de
Mbaamaan ô Boori ».
- Boori n'est-elle pas passée par ici ?
- Boori est passée par ici du temps où cette femme qui égrène le mil sous l'arbre à palabres
tétait encore sa mère.
Il se remit à courir, atteignit un hameau et dit :
« 0 Boori, ô Boori
Boori la brave
Si calme qu'était le troupeau
Boori était en éveil
Dans le troupeau de Mbaamaan ô Boori. »
- Boori n'est-elle pas passée par ici ?
- Boori est passée ici le jour du baptême de ce garçon qui doit être circoncis vendredi prochain.
Boori a même mangé de la bouillie de mil. Hâte le pas.
Il se remit à courir, courir jusqu'à un village et chanta :
« 0 Boori, ô Boori
Boori la brave
Si calme qu'était le troupeau
Boori était en éveil

Hâte le pas.
L’enfant courut et trouva le Peul en train de se laver les pieds. Il dit :
- Je cherche une vache du nom de Boori et c'est celle-ci.
- Laquelle ? dit le Peul.
- Celle-ci.
- Cette vache m'est destinée, voici sa mère, (répondit le Peul).
- Mon père m'avait envoyé en transhumance et je l'ai perdue, il a dit que je ne mangerai et ne
boirai que lorsque je la lui aurai ramenée car c'est elle la vache aînée du troupeau. J'ai fait
préparer du couscous et me suis lancé à travers la brousse. Cela fait trente ans que je la cherche.
Maintenant, faisons comme ceci. Je vais me mettre de côté et l'appeler Boori. Si elle ne me
répond pas, c'est signe qu'elle ne m'appartient pas ; si elle vient à moi, tu sauras qu'elle
m'appartient.
Le Peul répondit : Bismillahi.
Le jeune homme se mit de côté et chanta :
« O Boori, ô Boori
Boori la brave
Si calme qu'était le troupeau
Boori était en éveil
Dans le troupeau de Mbaamaan ô Boori. »
Boori commence à courir ; elle se jeta sur lui et se mit à le lécher.
- En toute franchise, cette vache t'appartient, prends-la et rentre chez toi, dit le Peul.

Carreau-de-beurre et Morceau-de-terre
Pays de collecte : Sénégal.
Un conte dit en français et en wolof par Pape Faye.
Carreau-de-beurre et Morceau-de-terre étaient co-épouses et Grande guêpe était leur mari.
Carreau-de-Beurre était chargée du puits, de la corvée d’eau. Morceau-de-Terre cuisinait. Un
morceau de terre ne fond pas au contact de la chaleur, et le beurre ne se dissout pas dans l’eau.
Elles vécurent ainsi longtemps. Mais un jour, elles se disputèrent. Et chacune d’elles décida de
s’abstenir de rendre service à l’autre. Ainsi Carreau-de-beurre dit à Morceau-de-terre :
- Désormais si tu comptes sur moi tu mourras de soif !
Morceau-de-terre répliqua :
- S’il te faut compter sur moi, toi aussi, tu mourras sûrement de faim !
Et chacune décida de s’occuper toute seule de ses charges.
Morceau-de-Terre se rendit au puits, mais au moment où elle puisait une goutte d’eau tomba
sur elle et la dissout. Carreau-de-Beurre se rendit à la cuisine, elle alimenta le feu, mais au
moment où elle se penchait pour souffler sur la braise, elle fondit. Grande guêpe se ceignit les
reins pour aller les enterrer, mais il se rompit la taille.

Un jour, Dieu décida de sonder son peuple et dit :
- Je vais voir parmi les créatures celle qui est disposée à supporter la mort.
Et il fit mourir le vautour.
Les vautours se mirent à se lamenter et à pleurer.
Ils pleuraient et ne faisaient que pleurer.
Alors Dieu dit :
- En vérité, ceux-ci ne supportent pas l’au-delà.
Et il tua l’être humain.
Alors les hommes se mirent à se lamenter, et à pleurer.
Puis à un moment donné, ils se calmèrent.
Et tout d’un coup, l’un d’eux éclata de rire.
Ils prirent des tam-tams et se mirent à taper, à applaudir, à danser et à se distraire, à se réjouir.
Alors Dieu dit :
- Voilà ! Ceux-ci supportent la mort.
Et l’humanité, depuis ce jour, connut la mort.

Fari l’ânesse
Pays de collecte : Sénégal.
Un conte dit en français et en wolof par Pape Faye.
Un conte
On t'écoute
Il était une fois
Il existe encore.
Il était une fois une jolie femme, si jolie, oh si jolie qu'elle ne semblait pas un être humain. Un roi
la vit et dit :
- Cette femme-là, il faut que je l'épouse !
Il partit la trouver, s'occupa de tout et l'épousa ; il l'amena dans sa demeure. Or, il se trouvait
que cette femme n'était pas un être humain, c'était une ânesse ! Chaque jour, au bout d'un
certain temps, elle disait qu'elle allait uriner, ou encore qu'elle allait se promener. Or, chaque
fois, elle se transformait, car ses congénères les ânes l'appelaient derrière le village.
Elle répéta cela, le répéta, le répéta jusqu'à ce qu'un jour elle demanda de partir en un lieu plus
éloigné, prétextant qu'elle allait voir ses parents. Le roi la laissa partir. Elle allait en réalité voir
les ânes de la brousse. Elle partit rejoindre les ânes et se transforma ; elle y resta en train de
braire.
Un Maure la vit. Il la suivit et alla se cacher derrière un arbre jusqu'à ce qu'elle commence à
braire. Alors le Maure se faufila furtivement et revint à la maison.
Il dit :
- Oh, Roi, je jure, aujourd'hui je vais te dire une chose, et si ce n'est pas vrai tu pourras me tuer !
Le roi lui dit :
- Ah Naar, moi, le menteur je le tue !
Le Maure lui répondit :
- Je jure ! Bour, ce que je dis est vrai, je le jure ! Ta femme-là, qui est si belle, si belle, belle, tu
comprends, c'est une ânesse, ce n'est pas une personne.
Le roi dit :
- Ah oui ?
Le maure :
- Oui !
Le roi dit :
- C'est bien !
Le Maure dit :
- Si elle te demande encore la permission, fais-moi accompagner par quelqu'un, ou toi-même,
suis-moi.
Un autre jour, la femme s'adressa encore au roi... Elle lui demanda la permission de sortir, le roi
lui dit :
- D'accord.
Le Maure fut accompagné d'un soldat. Ils suivirent la femme, la suivirent jusque dans la brousse.
Elle se transforma, rentra parmi les ânes; ils commencèrent à braire. Aussitôt les hommes s'en
retournèrent chez le roi.",French,Sénégal,amine

L'homme dit :
- Oh Roi, par Dieu ! Ce que le Maure a dit, c'est la vérité, je jure que c'est vrai !
Le roi dit :
- C'est bien, je verrai cela moi-même.
Il en fut ainsi. La femme, lorsqu'elle était dans sa demeure, les ânes ses semblables chantaient
dehors et dès qu'elle les entendait, elle disait qu'elle voulait sortir. Quand on eut découvert ses
manières d'agir, le roi se dit :
- Je verrai cela moi-même.
Et un jour, alors que le roi était assis à côté de sa femme, les ânes au dehors commencèrent à
chanter :
- Fari Dangan Dangani ... n'habite-t-elle pas par là ?
Dis, Fari toi.
Fari la reine des ânes est allée vivre ailleurs.
Elle refuse de revenir.
Le corps de la reine commença à se transformer, tout son corps. Brusquement, elle se
métamorphosa en ânesse, au beau milieu de la cour. Le roi prit son fusil et tira sur elle, elle
s'écroula. Puis, il fit appeler le Maure et le soldat pour les récompenser.
C'est là que le conte alla tomber dans la mer.

Koumba sans mère
Pays de collecte : Sénégal.
Un conte dit en français et en wolof par Pape Faye.
Il était un homme qui avait deux épouses. Chacune d'elles avait une fille. Allah fit qu'une des
femmes mourut et laissa sa fille. Les deux filles avaient le même nom. Pour les différencier, on
les surnomma : ""Koumba-avec-mère"" et ""Koumba-sans-mère"". Le père de famille craignait tant
son épouse, qu'il acceptait tout ce qu'elle faisait ou disait. Il la laissait faire accomplir à Koumba
l'orpheline tout le travail de la maison.
Un jour, en lavant la vaisselle, Koumba l'orpheline oublia de laver une cuillère en bois et sa
marâtre, furieuse, l'envoya la laver à la mer de Ndayane. Koumba, en pleurs, prit le chemin. Elle
marcha durant deux jours et deux nuits. Elle marcha, marcha, jusqu'à trouver sur son chemin un
jujubier en train de se gauler lui-même. Elle s'agenouilla et le salua. Et le jujubier lui demanda :
- Mais, où vas-tu, enfant bien éduquée ?
Koumba dit :
- La coépouse de ma mère défunte m'a envoyée laver cette cuillère à la mer de Ndayane.
Le jujubier lui donna des jujubes et lui dit :
- Que Dieu guide tes pas.
Koumba le remercia et reprit sa route.
Elle marcha encore et trouva sur son chemin une marmite en train de se cuire sur un feu.
Koumba-sans-mère s'agenouilla et la salua.
La marmite lui demanda :
- Mais, où vas-tu, jeune fille bien éduquée ?
Koumba lui répondit :
- La coépouse de ma mère défunte m'a envoyée laver cette cuillère à la mer de Ndayane.
La marmite prit une part de ce qu'elle cuisait et lui donna à manger. Elle lui dit :
- Que Dieu guide tes pas.
Après avoir bien mangé, elle la remercia et reprit sa route.
Koumba-sans-mère marcha, marcha encore et trouva sur son chemin une très vieille femme.
Elle n'avait qu’une jambe, un bras, un œil, une oreille, un doigt ; Koumba l'orpheline s'agenouilla
et la salua. La vieille femme lui demanda :
- Mais ma petite fille, où vas-tu ?
Koumba l'orpheline lui répondit :
- Grand-mère, la coépouse de ma mère défunte m'a envoyée laver cette cuillère à la mer de

La vieille femme lui remit alors un os blanchi, dégarni. Koumba ne dit rien, elle le prit et le mit
dans la marmite qui s'emplit aussitôt de viande.
Elle lui remit encore un grain de mil : Koumba le plaça dans un mortier. Elle pila, le mortier
s'emplit de couscous. Elle le prit et le mit dans la marmite ; elles le mangèrent. Jusqu’à ce que la
vieille femme lui dise :

Quand Koumba eut fini, la vieille femme lui remit une petite aiguille et une autre plus grosse, et
elle lui dit :
- Va te coucher maintenant sous le lit, car tous mes enfants sont des animaux sauvages. La
petite aiguille, tu l'emploieras à piquer les plus petits ; la plus grosse, tu la réserveras aux plus
grands pour qu'ils partent tôt. Je ne veux pas qu’ils te tuent !
Quand les enfants arrivèrent, Bouki, le plus têtu, dit :
- Mère, cela sent la chair humaine dans la chambre.
Sa mère lui répondit :
- Toi, va te coucher, je suis le seul être humain ici, tu veux me manger maintenant ?
Quand les animaux se furent couchés, Koumba les piqua avec la petite aiguille, à la manière des
puces. Les enfants ne purent dormir. Ils sortirent et repartirent à leurs affaires.
Koumba sortit, et la vieille lui demanda de se préparer pour retourner chez elle. Elle lui remit
trois œufs et lui dit :
- Celui-ci, tu le casseras quand tu seras au milieu de la brousse.
- Celui-là, tu le casseras quand tu apercevras ton village.
- Ce dernier tu le casseras quand tu seras à l'entrée de la maison. Fais attention, ne les confonds
pas.
- Vas-y mon enfant et que Dieu guide tes pas ! Koumba s'agenouilla, salua, remercia et s'en alla.
Elle marcha, elle marcha, marcha jusqu'au milieu de la brousse. Elle cassa le premier œuf. Des
cavaliers armés en sortirent.
Koumba se remit à marcher, marcher encore, et cassa le deuxième œuf. Des lions et des
panthères en sortirent. Les cavaliers les tuèrent.
Koumba marcha, marcha, marcha. Avant de pénétrer dans le village, elle cassa le dernier œuf ;
de nombreux esclaves, battant des tam-tams en sortirent et d'autres chargés de sacs d'argent,
d'or, et aussi de nombreux bœufs. Quand elle entra dans le village, Koumba avait un air royal.
Tout le monde était dehors pour la contempler.

L’enfant d’Allah
Pays de collecte : Sénégal.
Un conte dit en français et en wolof par Pape Faye.
Léeboon !
Lippoon !
Il était une fois !
C'est arrivé souvent !
C'était arrivé dans les temps passés, quand les animaux parlaient avec les hommes. Il y avait une
femme mauvaise, avec ses quatre fils. Ils habitaient au milieu de la brousse. Le père des enfants
mourut quand le cadet vint au monde : celui-ci s'appelait Tôni. La mère pensa que l'enfant était un
porte-malheur. Elle le détesta aussitôt. Quand elle revenait de chasse, elle appelait les enfants, un
par un, ils tétaient tous sauf Tôni. Elle chantait, disant :
""Diamloro Diamloro viens téter,
Diamloro viens téter
Diamloro Cissé, viens téter,
Diamloro Cissé, viens téter,
Birama Cissé, viens téter,
Birama Cissé, viens téter,
NDama Cissé, viens téter,
NDama Cissé, viens téter,
Que Tôni attende sa mère Yallah !""
Elle faisait ainsi maintes et maintes fois. Mais la méchante femme ne savait jamais qu'Allah
apparaissait à Tôni en génisse blanche pleine de lait, et le nourrissait.
Un jour, un malheur tomba sur la mère. Elle revint de la brousse et entonna la chanson qu'elle
chantait pour appeler les enfants. Juste à ce moment Bouki-l'hyène passait. Ce dernier écouta la
chanson, l'apprit jusqu'à bien la savoir.
Un jour, la maman des enfants s'en alla chasser, Bouki passa derrière elle, imita sa voix et chanta le
refrain. Les enfants sortirent un par un, Bouki les mangeait au fur et à mesure, sauf Tôni, qui se
cacha.
Quand la mère revint de la brousse, en chantant, personne ne lui répondit, elle s'étonna beaucoup.
Peu de temps après, elle entendit une voix familière lui répondre :
""Diamloro, Diamloro,
Diamloro, Bouki l'a pris
Birama Cissé, Diamloro,
Birama Cissé, Bouki l'a pris,
Ndama Cissé, Diamloro,
Ndama Cissé, Bouki l'a pris,
Tôni seul est resté avec Allah sa mère.""
Quand elle entendit cela, elle lança un cri perçant et s'enfuit dans la brousse.
C'est de là que le conte est parti dans la mer, le premier à le respirer ira au paradis.

L’hyène et l’aveugle
Pays de collecte : Sénégal.
Un conte dit en français par Massamba Guèye et en sérère par Raphaël Ndiaye.
L’hyène était là, elle n’avait plus rien à manger. Elle avait si faim qu’elle n’en pouvait plus. Dans
les rues du village, chaque fois qu’elle passait, elle voyait un aveugle debout, aux entrées des
maisons, disant seulement des formules magiques. Les gens lui donnaient de la nourriture qu’il
mettait dans ses sacs jusqu’à ce qu’ils soient pleins à craquer.
L’hyène regardait ces sacs. Partout où elle se rendait, elle était chassée. Elle se mit à regarder
cet aveugle, chaque jour, lorsque l’aveugle disait : « Lahi la la ! », on lui donnait de la nourriture,
jusqu’à ce que ses sacs soient pleins à craquer. Il rentrait chez lui.
L’hyène dit à l’aveugle : « Hé ! As-tu envie de retrouver la vue ? »
L’aveugle dit : « C’est tout ce que je demande à Dieu le Maître ! »
Elle dit : « Pour ce qui me concerne moi, je veux être aveugle ! »
L’hyène ajouta : « Veux-tu que nous fassions un échange et que tu m’apprennes tes incantations
? »
L’aveugle lui répondit : « Oui, je t’apprendrai les formules magiques, ainsi tu pourras demander
l’aumône ! »
L’hyène devint aveugle et l’aveugle retrouva la vue. L’aveugle lui remit les formules magiques.
Le premier jour, elle récita les formules magiques et remplit ses sacs avec de la nourriture
jusqu’à ce qu’ils soient pleins à ras bord.
L’hyène alla se coucher dans sa case et se mit à parloter. Dès qu’elle commença à sentir la faim,
elle accrocha les sacs à ses épaules. Elle arriva à mi-chemin et oublia les formules ! Elle ne
connaissait plus les formules magiques, et elle ne pouvait plus savoir qui était l’aveugle.
Alors, elle resta là, bêtement !",French,Sénégal,amine

L’hyène, Héraut de Dieu
Pays de collecte : Sénégal.
Un conte dit en français par Massamba Guèye.
Un jour, Dieu chargea le lièvre d’une mission et lui dit :
- Va dire aux hommes ceci :
« Dieu a dit que la lune est destinée à disparaître à jamais après sa mort,
Tandis que l’homme est, lui, destiné à mourir et à revenir. »
Le lièvre s’en alla, et à mi-chemin, il rencontra l’hyène.
L’hyène lui demanda :
- Eh Ndol Seen, le Lièvre ! Où vas-tu donc de ce pas ?
Le lièvre lui répondit :
- Dieu m’a envoyé dire aux hommes que la lune doit mourir et disparaître, et l’homme mourir et
revenir.
L’hyène lui dit :
- Retourne chez toi. Je peux faire la commission à ta place.
Puis elle s’en alla et annonça :
- Eeehey ! Écoutez !
Dieu décrète que les hommes sont destinés à mourir pour ne jamais revenir, et la lune destinée
à mourir et à renaître.
Alors Dieu protesta :
- Non ! Non ! Je n’ai pas dit cela.
Mais qu’à cela ne tienne ! Dieu n’entend que la première parole.
Désormais, ce sont les hommes qui disparaîtront à leur mort.
Tandis que la lune reviendra toujours après sa mort.
Voilà pourquoi la lune meurt et revient toujours,
Alors que l’homme disparaît définitivement à sa mort.

La djinné, la jeune femme et l’oiseau
Pays de collecte : Sénégal.
Un conte dit en français et en wolof par Pape Faye.
Il y avait un homme qui était riche, et beau de surcroît, mais il n'avait pas de femme, car celles
qu'on lui donnait dans le pays, même belles, il disait qu'il n'en voulait pas. Celles qu'on lui
choisissait, il disait qu'il n'en voulait pas. Un jour, il prit son cheval, et dit qu'il allait chercher une
femme pour savoir s'il en obtiendrait. Il monta sur son cheval, il partit.
Il galopa, galopa, galopa, galopa, galopa jusqu'à la forêt. Il rencontra un vieil homme, il lui fit
l'aumône. Le vieil homme lui dit :
- Mon fils où vas-tu ?
Il lui répondit :
- Moi, dans le pays où je suis né, celle qu'on m'offrait comme femme, il se trouvait que je ne
l'aimais pas.
Celle que l’on me donnait, je ne l'aimais pas, alors, je voulus aller chercher moi-même.
Le vieux lui dit :
- Quand tu iras jusqu'au milieu de la forêt, tu y verras des citronniers, quand tu avanceras
jusqu'au milieu des arbres, tu verras trois citrons. Tu les cueilleras ensemble. Quand tu seras en
pleine forêt, et quand tu éplucheras un citron, quelqu'un en sortira, elle te demandera quelque
chose.
L'homme dit :
- Oui.
Il conduisit son cheval, le conduisit, le conduisit jusqu'en pleine forêt, jusqu'à ce qu'il vit les trois
arbres. Il s'enfonça, vit les trois citrons, les cueillit ensemble. Il chevaucha jusqu'au cœur de la
forêt, éplucha l'un. Une jolie femme en sortit et lui dit :
- Père, donne-moi du tabac.
Il lui dit :
- Moi, je n'ai pas de tabac.
Elle lui dit :
- Donne-moi du pain.
- Moi je n'ai pas de pain.
- Donc toi, tu ne peux pas m'entretenir, je retourne à ma coque.
Il lui restait deux citrons. Il reprit sa course, chevaucha jusqu'en pleine forêt. Il en éplucha un
autre. Une plus belle fille que la première en sortit, lui dit :
- Père, donne-moi du pain.
Il lui dit :
- Moi, je n'ai pas de pain.
- Donne-moi du tabac.
- Moi, je n'ai pas de tabac.
- Donc toi, tu ne peux pas m'entretenir, je retourne à ma coque.
Il lui restait un citron. Il s'en alla acheter son pain et son tabac. Il chevaucha, chevaucha,
chevaucha encore au plus profond de la forêt. Il éplucha le citron qui lui restait. Une fille plus
belle encore que celles-là, en sortit et lui dit :
- Père, donne-moi du pain.

Elle lui dit :

Elle lui dit :
- C'est avec toi que je veux rester.

- Maintenant, nous allons faire une chose : je veux partir dans notre pays apprendre aux gens là-
bas que j'ai une femme, pour qu'ils puissent nous accueillir. Je veux que tu habites ma maison
ici. Nous y resterons jusqu'à ce que je parte. Sa maison alors était en haut d'un arbre, et
surplombait la mer.
La jeune femme lui dit :
- Oui.
Ils y restèrent jusqu'à ce qu'ils aient un garçon. Et le mari partit l'annoncer aux gens du pays. Et il
s'en alla. Quand la femme se levait, et que son enfant dormait, elle se penchait à l'étage. Son
ombre se reflétait ainsi sur l'eau. Une Djinné vint y chercher de l'eau ; elle regarda l'ombre et la
sienne.
Elle s'exclama:
- Ei ! Moi je suis aussi belle que ça ! Belle à ce point ! Et l'on m'envoie chercher de l'eau ! Elle
brisa le canari et s'en alla.
Le lendemain encore, quand elle vint chercher de l'eau, la djinné dit :
- Ei ! Moi je suis alors aussi belle que ça ! Belle à ce point et l'on m'envoie chercher de l'eau !
Elle brisa le canari.
À la troisième fois, elle revint, regarda l'ombre et dit :
- Ei ! Moi, je suis donc aussi belle que ça.
Belle à ce point et l'on m'envoie chercher de l'eau !
- Elle brisa le canari.
La femme d'en haut s'esclaffa.
La djinné lui dit :
- Aââ hâââ ! Alors ! C'est donc toi qui es perchée là, et quand je venais, je me croyais aussi belle.
Alors que c'est toi qui es perchée là-haut ! Descends, que je te tresse.
La femme lui dit :
- En tout cas moi, je ne descends pas, car mon mari me l’a défendu.
La djinné lui dit :
- Descends seulement, ça ne durera pas, les tresses ne dureront pas longtemps, je te ferai de
jolies tresses, comme ça quand ton mari viendra...
Elle descendit.
Le génie la tressa ; ensuite elle prit une épingle qu'elle lui planta au milieu du crâne. La femme
se change en oiseau, prit son vol, s'en alla... un bel oiseau. La djinné monta la remplacer en haut.
Quand l'enfant s'éveillait, elle le portait. Jusqu'à ce que le mari revint. Il lui dit :
- Moo ! Où est ma femme ?

Il dit :
- Ei ? Moi, que vais-je devenir, avec ma honte ? J'ai averti les gens de mon pays, et ils préparent

amène ce laideron !

Ainsi allaient les choses, puis un jour,
L'homme dit :
- Allons ramasser des oiseaux dans la forêt.
On partit, et l'on ramassa, ramassa, ramassa... Jusqu'à ce que l'on ramassât la mère de l'enfant
changée en oiseau. C'était un bel oiseau.
On vint alors le mettre dans la maison.
L'oiseau aimait l'enfant ! L’enfant grandit ! L'oiseau l'aimait à en mourir.
À tout moment, il se posait sur lui, il le caressait.
La djinné dit :
- Cet oiseau-là, tuons-le.
Demain, nous tuerons tous les oiseaux. L'enfant pleurait et demandait qu'on ne tue point
l'oiseau. Il pleurait et demandait à son père qu'on ne le tue pas. Jusqu'au jour où on étala la
natte pour manger.
L'oiseau vint et tchapp ! Il se posa au milieu du plat. L'enfant le caressa, le caressa, Il ôta
l'épingle piquée dans sa tête. L'oiseau redevint sa mère. La djinné mourut là-bas. Alors l'homme
dit aux gens du pays :

Le chasseur et le génie voleur de femmes
Pays de collecte : Sénégal.
Un conte dit en français et en wolof par Pape Faye.
C'est un conte.
Dites-nous un conte.
Il était une fois.
Cela existe encore.
Il y avait un génie qui volait la femme des nouveaux mariés.
Quiconque se mariait se voyait privé de sa nouvelle épouse, enlevée par le génie.
Un brave et téméraire chasseur apprit la nouvelle et annonça qu'il irait chercher une femme
dans ce pays, afin de savoir si les hommes y sont sans valeur.
Après avoir dit cela, il se prépara et partit. Quand il arriva dans la cité, on le reçut avec faste. Le
roi lui demanda le motif de sa visite. Le chasseur lui dit qu'il venait prendre femme.
Le roi lui dit :
- Ici tu ne peux obtenir une femme, car à tous ceux à qui on a donné une épouse, le génie l'a
enlevée et toutes ces épouses ont été ainsi perdues à jamais.
Le jeune homme répondit au roi :
- Moi je suis un chasseur. Le génie, la bravoure qu'il nous montre,... si tu me donnes ta fille en
mariage et s'il me la prend, je lutterai avec lui. Toi, observe-moi simplement, ne te préoccupes
que de moi.
Le roi dit :
- Ce que tu dis, est-ce que c'est sûr ?
L'homme répondit :
- C'est sûr.
Le roi lui donna une femme. Le mariage fut célébré durant trois jours.
Lorsque les invités furent partis, le jeune homme rentra avec son épouse dans leur chambre.
Dès qu'ils se couchèrent, le mari tenta de la toucher dans l'obscurité, mais ne trouva rien. Il
s'inquiéta. Il se leva et alla voir le père de la mariée. Il lui dit qu'en effet, il avait eu raison. Le
génie est venu voler son épouse !
Le matin, il alla trouver un marabout et lui dit :
- J'ai épousé une femme et le génie est venu la prendre.
Le marabout regarda les signes et lui dit : « Le génie, toutes les personnes qu'il a enlevées d'ici, il
les a emportées au-delà du fleuve. Si tu peux dépasser le fleuve, tu pourras tuer les génies. Les
génies se trouvent dans une antilope-jument. Dans cette antilope, il y a un kewel. Dans cette
petite antilope, il y a un corbeau. Dans ce corbeau, il y a un œuf. Cet œuf, si tu l'écrases, les
femmes volées par le génie vont t'apparaître ».
Le marabout dit encore :
- L’antilope Koba quitte (son logis) vers onze heures pour aller boire à la roche qui se trouve
dans le fleuve. Louti est son nom.
Le chasseur partit, prit sa gibecière, y mit sa nourriture et se fit accompagner de son chien.",French,Sénégal,amine

Aussitôt qu'ils furent sortis de la ville, un lion les vit, rugit et courut vers eux.
L'homme s'agenouilla pour tirer, le lion lui demanda :
- Que vas-tu faire ?
Le chasseur lui dit :
- On a volé ma femme, je suis à sa recherche; si tu veux m'attaquer, je te tue !
Le lion lui dit :
- Partons donc, je m'en vais t'aider. Ce que peut faire un ou deux, trois le feront mieux.
Ils marchèrent longtemps ; un aigle venant on ne sait d'où plana au-dessus du chasseur.
L'homme voulut le tuer, l'aigle dit :
- Que vas-tu faire de moi ?
- On a volé ma femme, je suis à sa recherche. Si tu m'attaques, je te tue tout de suite.
L'aigle lui dit :
- Allons-y, je vais t'aider. Ce que deux ou trois peuvent, quatre le pourront mieux.
L'homme, avec les trois animaux, chemina dans la brousse. Quand ils arrivèrent au bord du
fleuve, le lion creusa un trou profond, ils s'y tapirent, bien cachés.
Vers onze heures, l'antilope-Koba arriva pour boire au rocher du fleuve. Le lion bondit et tomba
sur elle ; il l'éventra. La petite antilope sortit du ventre et se mit à courir. Le chien la poursuivit.
Ils coururent sur deux longueurs de sas, le chien l'attrapa et l'éventra. Un corbeau en sortit et
s'envola. L'aigle le rencontra en l'air et le percuta, le corbeau tomba, l'aigle l'éventra. Un œuf en
sortit et roula sur le sol, le chasseur l'écrasa.
Aussitôt on entendit de l'autre rive du fleuve, les cris de nombreuses femmes.
L'homme retourna à la ville pour appeler les habitants. Quand ils vinrent, chacun prit sa pirogue,
le chasseur, lui, monta sur le lion, ils traversèrent le fleuve. Là-bas il reconnut sa femme, la reprit
et rentra avec elle.
C'est là que le conte alla tomber dans la mer ; celui qui le respire ira au paradis.

Un conte dit en français par Massamba Guèye et en sérère par Raphaël Ndiaye.
Il était une fois un enfant terrassé par une maladie, une très grave maladie. Son père alla
chercher un guérisseur. Le vieux guérisseur arriva, examina l’enfant, puis appela le père et lui
dit :
- Ton fils est gravement malade. Il est si malade que son âme est en train de le quitter. Bref il va
mourir. Ne te fatigue plus.
Le père le supplia et lui dit :
- Il ne faut pas que cela arrive ! Aide-moi !
Il lui répondit :
- Eh bien ! Je peux faire une chose, si tu acceptes, je retire l’âme de ton âne que voici attaché
derrière ta case, je la transmets à l’enfant et il se relève. Mais je te préviens : il sera en
apparence une personne mais sans aucun équilibre. Il pourra certes travailler comme tous les
autres hommes, mais il mènera une vie particulière. Le père répondit :
- Je préfère cela à sa mort.
Le vieil homme prit congé, et la nuit, il fit ce qu’il fit. Le lendemain, on trouva l’âne les dents en
l’air, foudroyé par la mort. On releva le malade et il s’assit. On lui présenta de l’eau et il en but.
On lui prépara de la nourriture et il en mangea.
Jusqu’à présent ce garçon-là, aucune fourmi ne l’a piqué : il est sain et sauf. Il vit toujours.
Cependant tout le monde convient qu’il est sans personnalité. Il est aussi turbulent que le sexe

quand elle se réveilla elle ne vit plus l'enfant. Elle le chercha partout en vain. Elle pleura jusqu'à
n'avoir plus de larmes et s'en remit à Dieu. Elle reprit son chemin.
Elle arriva dans un autre grand pays, et y reprit ses fonctions d'esclave à la cour. Ce roi aussi
était très méchant.
Il se trouvait que l'enfant avait été enlevé par une femme génie, qui le nourrissait et qui
s'occupait de lui jusqu'à ce qu'il eût grandi. L'enfant lui servait de berger, accompagné du fils de
la femme génie ! Un jour, il dit à ce fils :
- Moi, ma mère me manque beaucoup !
L'enfant de la femme génie lui répondit :
- Toi, tu sais que ma mère t'aime beaucoup. Quand tu reviendras à la maison, tu t'assiéras
quelque part, tranquille comme si tu étais malade. Si elle te demande ce que tu as, tu répondras
que ta mère te manque et que tu veux lui rendre visite. Ainsi elle te laissera partir.
Au retour des pâturages, l'enfant fit ce que lui avait recommandé le fils de la femme génie. La
femme lui demanda ce qu'il avait. Il dit :
- Ma mère me manque, je voudrais lui rendre visite.
Le génie lui dit :
- Demain je te laisserai partir. Le lendemain, elle lui donna cent bœufs, cent moutons, cent
chèvres, cent ânes, une outre pleine d'or et une outre pleine d'argent. Elle lui donna aussi de
nombreux guerriers à cheval. L'enfant prit la tête du cortège.",French,Sénégal,amine

Avant qu'il ne parte, elle lui dit :
- Tu ne connais pas ta mère, tu ne sais pas aussi où elle se trouve. Je te dirai donc ceci :
beaucoup de femmes te diront qu'elles sont ta mère, mais tu leur demanderas en quel lieu elles
t'ont enfanté, avec quoi elles ont coupé ton cordon ombilical, et ce qu'elles t'ont donné ensuite.
Celle qui est ta mère, elle te dira: « Je t'ai mis au monde sur la rive d'un fleuve, j'ai coupé ton
cordon avec un morceau de canne à sucre, je t'ai passé au poignet un bracelet ». Celle qui n'est
pas ta mère ne pourra pas te donner ces réponses.
Ils se dirent adieu. L'enfant prit la route avec ses richesses et ses guerriers. Ils marchèrent,
marchèrent jusqu'en vue d'une cité.
Quand ils y pénétrèrent, une femme vint à sa rencontre et lui dit :
- Beau jeune homme, où vas-tu ?
- Je suis à la recherche de ma mère.
- Je suis ta mère.
- Où m'as-tu enfanté ?
- Dans ma maison.
- Avec quoi as-tu coupé mon cordon ?
- Avec un couteau.
- Que m'avais-tu offert à ma naissance ?
- Le lait de mon sein.
- Toi tu n'es pas ma mère, dit l'enfant.
Une autre femme arriva et déclara qu'elle était sa mère.
- Où m'as-tu donné le jour ? demanda l'enfant.
- Dans mon arrière-cour.
- Toi non plus, tu n'es pas ma mère, dit l'enfant.
Toutes les femmes de l'endroit vinrent mais aucune n'était sa mère. Il reprit sa route vers une
autre cité. Dans cette dernière, il ne trouva pas non plus sa mère. Il traversa ainsi de nombreux
villages sans trouver sa mère. Il arriva enfin dans cette cité où sa mère vivait.
Toute femme qui voyait ses nombreuses richesses affirmait être sa mère.
Toutes les femmes du pays furent donc interrogées par l'enfant, l'une après l'autre, mais aucune
ne donna les réponses de la femme génie.
Une femme dit alors :
- Appelez donc l'esclave, peut-être que c'est elle.
Toutes s'exclamèrent :
- Tu sais que cela ne peut pas être elle ! Celle-ci ne peut donner le jour à un enfant aussi beau, à
un enfant aussi riche !
Sa mère s'approcha, le regarda, et le reconnut. Elle s'élança vers lui, et lui dit :
- Je suis ta mère.
L'enfant demanda :
- Où m'as-tu enfanté ?
- Au bord du fleuve.
- Avec quoi as-tu coupé mon cordon ?
- Avec un morceau de canne à sucre.
- Que m'as-tu donné à ma naissance ?
- Un bracelet offert par ton père lors de notre mariage.",French,Sénégal,amine

L'enfant fut très heureux et cria :
- C'est toi qui es ma mère !
L'enfant la débarrassa de ses haillons, lui offrit des habits neufs, la mit sur le plus gros cheval et
lui dit :
- Rentrons dans notre pays.
Quand ils arrivèrent dans leur contrée, ses guerriers attaquèrent le roi, le défirent, et l'enfant
devint roi.
Il affranchit tous les esclaves leur donna la moitié de ses richesses et tous furent heureux.
D'autres villages déménagèrent et vinrent s'ajouter au sien. Son pays fut un grand pays, tout le
monde en parlait.

Le lion et la jument
Pays de collecte : Sénégal.
Un conte dit en français par Massamba Guèye.
Il était une fois un roi. Un roi amoureux de la femme d’un de ses sujets. Un jour, il fit venir le sujet et
l’envoya en mission dans un pays lointain. Le sujet partit. Le roi rendit visite à sa femme et il lui dit :
- Je viens passer la journée avec toi.
Elle lui répondit :
- Passer la journée avec moi ?
Il dit :
- En effet.
La femme fut fort embarrassée, se demandant ce qui pouvait pousser le roi à venir passer la journée
chez elle, alors qu’il venait d’envoyer son mari en mission. Mais en femme bien éduquée, elle décida
de tuer un bélier, et de l’apprêter pour l’honorer.
Après la cuisson, elle partagea le repas en trois parts. Puis elle disposa les récipients avec soin et vint
servir le roi. Le roi se lava les mains et enleva le couvercle. Il entama le premier plat, en mangea un
peu et le repoussa. Puis il découvrit le second récipient et vit qu’il contenait le même mets. Il en
mangea un peu et le repoussa. Ensuite il découvrit le dernier plat et constata qu’il s’agissait du même
mets. Alors le roi comprit. Il vit que la femme l’invitait à comprendre que les femmes qu’il a laissées
dans sa maison et elle-même, qu’il est venu courtiser, étaient toutes pareilles.
Le roi portait une bague. Au moment où il se nettoyait les mains, il perdit la bague dans l’eau. Les
gens de la noblesse, appelés garmi, avaient beaucoup de scrupules ! C’est pourquoi le roi ne voulut
pas signaler la perte de sa bague. Il se leva aussitôt et retourna chez lui, et il oublia la bague.
La femme recueillit la bague et la garda sous son oreiller. À la fin de sa mission, le mari revint à la
maison. Il se coucha sur le lit et découvrit la bague, mais il ne réagit point. Il ne dit rien à sa femme.
Seulement il déserta le lit et décida désormais de se coucher à même le sol.
La femme fut fort éprouvée par cette attitude. Elle la subit longtemps, jusqu’au supplice. Puis elle
alla trouver son père et se confia à lui. Le père porta aussitôt l’affaire devant le roi.
Désignant le mari, il dit :
- L’homme que voici, j’ai dressé ma jument, je l’ai dressée, dressée au point que sans cesse elle
cabriole ; puis je décidai de la confier à cet homme. Il hérita de la jument et la soigna, de telle sorte
que quiconque la côtoie tombe sous son charme. Ensuite, il s’est désintéressé d’elle.
Je veux comprendre pourquoi, que cet homme se justifie.
Le roi interpella le mari. Et lui demanda de se justifier. Le mari lui dit :
- La jument, je l’ai en effet soignée, au point que tout homme qui la côtoie tombe sous son charme.
Et voici que je pénètre dans son écurie et j’y découvre des traces de pattes de lion. Or moi, j’ai peur
du lion. Voilà pourquoi je me suis éloigné d’elle.
Alors le roi lui dit :
- Dans ce cas, retourne chez toi et continue de soigner ta jument.  Le lion était peut être seulement
de passage dans ton écurie, mais il n’y mettra plus ses pattes.
Sur ces mots l’assemblée se retira sans percer le vrai mystère de ce débat.

Les trois vérités de Bouc
Pays de collecte : Sénégal.
Un conte dit en français par Massamba Guèye et en sérère par Raphaël Ndiaye.
Un jour, Bouc, séduit par la religion musulmane se convertit à l’Islam.
Il décida de se rendre à la Mecque, en pèlerinage.
Il partit, il marcha, il marcha, et il tomba Ratch ! sur Hyène.
Alors Hyène lui demanda :
- Eh, Bouc ! Où vas-tu donc ainsi, tout seul ? »
Il répondit :
- Eh bien, je vais à la Mecque. Je suis converti à l’Islam.
Hyène lui dit :
- Dans ce cas tu es bien arrivé. La Mecque c’est ici.
Devinant ses intentions, Bouc le supplia et dit :
- De grâce, épargne-moi. Je suis père de famille.
Hyène leva le museau, éternua et lui dit :
- Tu ne partiras pas d’ici sans me dire trois vérités indiscutables.
Bouc fit Thioum, réfléchit un moment et lui dit :
- Ah oui ?
Il répondit :
- Absolument. Avant de partir d’ici, tu me diras trois vérités que personne ne pourra remettre en
cause.
Bouc lui dit :
- Oncle Hyène, si j’étais convaincu qu’en prenant ce chemin j’allais à ta rencontre
Dieu sait que je ne l’aurais jamais pris.
Hyène fit Thioum, resta interdite un moment et lui dit :
- Tu as raison. Une.
Bouc réfléchit à nouveau et dit :
- Si je rentre au village, et déclare que j’ai rencontré l’hyène dans la brousse l’on me traitera de
menteur.
Il lui dit :
- Tu as encore raison. Deux. Il reste une vérité.
Bouc à nouveau fit Thioum, puis il déclare :
- Je suis en tout cas certain d’une chose.
Hyène demanda :
- Laquelle ?
Il dit :
- Toute cette palabre, c’est parce que tu n’as pas faim.
Hyène dit :
- Juste ! Atcha ! Tu peux donc partir.
Bouc s’enfuit : Fouy ! Et sauva sa vie.

Qui peut m’aider à mettre cette charge sur
ma tête ?
Pays de collecte : Sénégal.
Un conte dit en français par Massamba Guèye et en sérère par Raphaël Ndiaye.
Il était une fois une femme enceinte qui était allée chercher du bois mort. Lorsqu'elle eut
rassemblé la quantité voulue, elle n'eut personne pour l'aider à poser la charge sur sa tête.
Alors elle appela :
- Quelle créature de la forêt pourrait m'aider à mettre cette charge sur ma tête ?
Le margouillat se présenta. La femme lui dit :
- Ôte-toi de là, tu ne peux pas !
- Quelle créature de la forêt pourrait m'aider à mettre cette charge sur ma tête ?
Le lézard vint. Elle lui dit :
- Ôte-toi de là, tu ne peux pas !
- Quelle créature de la forêt pourrait m'aider à mettre cette charge sur ma tête ?
Le lion vint. Elle lui dit :
- Toi, tu en es capable.
- Si je t'aide, que me donneras-tu en retour ?
- Ce que je porte dans mon ventre, répondit-elle.
Njogoy, le lion l'aida ; elle s'en retourna au village. Elle accoucha d'un garçon du nom de Samba.
Le lion attendit avec impatience quelques années, puis un jour, il se dirigea vers le village et
demanda à Samba :
- Peut-on te manger ou faut-il encore attendre ?
La femme dit : « Attends encore, le moment n'est pas venu ».
Le lion s'en retourna, attendit un certain temps, puis revint au village et dit :
- Peut-on te manger ou faut-il encore attendre ?
- Il reste encore un mois, répondit la mère.
Samba décida un matin :
- C'est moi qui vais faire paître le troupeau.
Et il partit. Le lion vint en son absence.
- Peut-on le manger ou faut-il encore attendre ?
- Le voilà qui vient de partir au troupeau, répondit la mère.
Le lion attendit, attendit, puis il alla le trouver à l'enclos :
- Est-ce bien Samba ?
- Oui, c'est moi.
- Peut-on te manger ou faut-il encore attendre ?
- On peut me manger, dit Samba !
Ils se ruèrent l'un sur l'autre et se mirent à se battre, à se battre, Samba tua le lion, lui coupa
une griffe et retourna au village.",French,Sénégal,amine

À son arrivée, sa mère lui servit à souper. Il en mangea un peu, puis enfouit la griffe dans le
restant du couscous. Il dit :
- Mère, viens prendre le plat.
La mère prit le plat et aussitôt se mit à manger. A peine avait-elle avalé une bouchée que la
griffe lui resta dans la gorge. Elle s'évanouit. Alors que tout le monde s'affairait, Samba ne disait
mot. Lorsqu'il la sentit près de mourir, Samba lui donna une grande tape dans le dos et la griffe
tomba par terre. Il lui dit :
- Voilà le lion à qui tu m'avais donné en gage !

Un malheur ne vient jamais seul
Pays de collecte : Sénégal.
Un conte dit en français et en wolof par Pape Faye.
Un conte.
On t'écoute.
Il était une fois.
Cela existe encore.
Il était une fois une vieille femme qui partageait sa case avec un serpent et un oiseau. Chaque
fois que l'oiseau pondait, le serpent avalait l'œuf.
N'en pouvant plus, l'oiseau alla voir la personne et lui dit :
- Un malheur ne vient jamais seul et seule la paix préserve le bon voisinage. Je voudrais que tu
ailles dire au serpent d'arrêter d'avaler mes œufs.
La vieille lui répondit :
- Qu'est-ce qu'une personne vient faire dans une querelle de serpent et d'oiseau ? Cela ne me
concerne pas. Va voir un autre.
L'oiseau s'en alla voir la souris ; celle-ci dressa ses moustaches et se mit debout. Alors l'oiseau lui
parla :
- Je voudrais que tu ailles voir la personne pour qu'elle dise au serpent de cesser d'avaler mes
œufs ; chaque fois que je ponds un œuf, il l'avale.
La souris répondit :
- Tu sais bien que je vis toujours cachée dans la case de la personne ; si elle me voit, aussitôt je
meurs. Comment donc irais-je voir la personne pour qu'elle parle au serpent ? Va voir un autre,
cela ne me concerne pas.
L'oiseau répliqua :
- Ah ! Bon ! D’accord ! Un malheur ne vient jamais seul.
L'oiseau consulta l'araignée. Il lui dit : s’il te plaît, va dire à la personne d'avertir le serpent pour
qu'il épargne mes œufs ; chaque fois que je ponds un œuf, il l'avale, chaque fois que je ponds un
œuf, il l'avale.
L'araignée répondit :
- Moi, toute toile que je fabrique la nuit dans la case, la personne la défait quand elle se réveille.
Je ne peux donc pas lui dire de ta part quoi que ce soit. Va voir un autre.
L'oiseau alla voir le chien et lui dit :
- Chien, nous sommes tous dans la case. Je voudrais que tu dises à la personne d'avertir le
serpent pour qu'il cesse d'avaler mes œufs, car un malheur ne vient jamais seul.
Le chien lui répondit :
- Moi, je garde la maison de la personne toute la nuit, mais quand son repas est prêt, je n'ai à
ronger que les restes laissés par les enfants. Cette affaire ne me concerne pas, va voir un autre !
L'oiseau dit :
- Je vais donc voir l'âne.",French,Sénégal,amine

Il lui parla en ces termes :
- Âne, je voudrais t'envoyer dire à la personne de dire au serpent de laisser mes œufs, car tu sais
bien qu'un malheur ne vient jamais seul ! La paix préserve le bon voisinage.
L'âne lui répondit :
- Tu sais que la personne m'accable de fardeaux et en plus, elle se met derrière moi et me
frappe avec son bâton. Et qu'est-ce qu'un âne vient faire dans une querelle opposant un oiseau
et un serpent ? Va voir un autre. Je n'irai pas lui dire quoi que ce soit parce qu'elle ne m'aime
pas, elle est mon ennemie !
L’oiseau alla trouver le coq, le coq lui dit :
- Moi, la personne, c'est mon chant qui la tire de son sommeil, mais quand elle reçoit un
étranger, elle ordonne qu'on m'attrape et qu'on m'égorge ; la personne est mon ennemie. Je ne
peux aller la voir pour qu'elle arrange une histoire entre le serpent et l'oiseau. Ça ne me
concerne pas, va voir un autre.
L'oiseau dit :
- C'est bon ! Un malheur ne vient jamais seul et seule la paix préserve le bon voisinage. Je vous ai
tous dit d'interdire au serpent d'avaler mes œufs et vous dites que cela ne vous concerne pas. Je
vais voir le mouton.
L'oiseau dit au mouton :
- Je voudrais que tu ailles voir la personne afin qu'elle parle au serpent ; chaque fois que je
ponds un œuf, il l'avale, chaque fois que je ponds un œuf, il l'avale, et tu sais qu'un malheur ne
vient jamais seul !
Le mouton lui répondit :
- La personne m'entretient jusqu'à ce que je sois gras, m'élève dans sa cour jusqu'à ce que je
devienne grand, et pourtant quand la Tabaski arrive, elle ordonne qu'on m'attrape et qu'on
m'égorge. Une querelle entre une personne, un oiseau et un serpent ne me concerne pas. Va
voir un autre.
L'oiseau dit :
- Ah bon ?
L'autre dit :
- Oui.
Il dit :
- D'accord !
L'oiseau partit chercher une allumette. Quand il revint, il dit :
- Maintenant, j'ai parlé, je suis fatigué. Chaque fois que j'envoie quelqu'un, il refuse. Je vais faire
ce qui me convient.
Il prit l'allumette et mit le feu à la case.
La personne, l'âne, l'araignée, la souris, tous périrent dans l'incendie. L'âne qui était allé appeler
au secours mourut au retour, brûlé par le feu.
Quant au mouton, il servit de repas à ceux qui étaient venus éteindre le feu et refaire la case.
